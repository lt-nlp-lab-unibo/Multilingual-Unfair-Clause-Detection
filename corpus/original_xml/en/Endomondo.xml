Appendix A: Under Armour Shopping

<use2>By shopping with us using Under Armour Shopping, you agree to these terms and conditions.</use2> These terms and conditions apply to all offers and agreements in connection with the online sale and delivery of Under Armour apparel, shoes and accessories (“UA Apparel”), but excluding digital products and services (e.g., Premium Memberships), which are expressly addressed in Section 8 of the Terms above. Accordingly, the specific terms and conditions set forth below apply when you order any UA Apparel (i) from underarmour.com, or UA.com, of any of its country extensions; (ii) from any site that is directly connected to UA.com; or (iii) any Under Armour e-commerce or shopping application (collectively, “Under Armour Shopping”).
(a) Account Registration

An account is not required to shop via Under Armour Shopping. To make online shopping faster and easier, however, you may register for an account with us on one of our websites or applications. Please confirm your email address when creating your account as we will use the email address on file to contact you. If you have an account, you will have the ability to track shipments, view past orders, and quickly access your shipping and billing information with a username and password. If you do not want to set up an account, you can still purchase from Under Armour Shopping as a “Guest.”
(b) Online Availability

When shopping, once you’ve selected the item you wish to purchase you can determine what color/size is in stock by first selecting the color (1.Select Color), and then the size (2.Select Size). If the size you want is not listed for the selected color, it is not available. Although Under Armour Shopping is designed to feature “real-time” inventory levels so that only in-stock items are visible and available for purchase, we may experience shortages of stock due to overwhelming popularity of a particular style, color or size, and cannot guarantee that items which appear to be in stock are actually available. If the item you would like to purchase is currently out of stock, we apologize for the inconvenience and encourage you to call our customer service line so that we may help you find a similar product.
© Locating the Style Number

If you are looking for a product’s style number, it is located inside your garment on a small white tag. It will read, for example, FW081100200 or on older styles FW060375. The first four characters reference the season of the style (ex. FW06=Fall/Winter 2006) (although, depending on region, the style number for some products may not include the first four characters) and the last seven (on new styles) or four (on older styles) characters reference the style number. You can search this style number on our Services to find exactly what you are looking for. If no results are found, the style may no longer be manufactured by Under Armour. Please contact our customer service team for assistance in finding a replacement product.
(d) Ordering and Changes to Orders

When you place an order we will send a confirmation email to the address you have provided. If you are using your workplace email address, be aware that many corporations use spam filters to disqualify incoming automated emails, which could hamper delivery of our confirmation email to you or send it to junk mail.

The “confirmation” stage sets out the final details of your order. Following this, we will send you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products you have ordered. Please note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from Under Armour. Acceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between us will occur upon our dispatch to you of the products ordered, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it.

Due to the close time frame between order and shipment, it is difficult to make changes once your order has been placed. However, if you contact us within an hour of placing your order and we will attempt to facilitate a change.
(e) Tax

Sales Tax and similar taxes, such as value added tax (“VAT”), are calculated using local and national rates depending on where you are located. Where VAT is applicable, you will be charged at the local rate and it will be included in the product price.
(f) Payment

Under Armour reserves the right to supplement the list of acceptable forms of payment for Under Armour Shopping. We may require credit cards and debit cards to be issued by an institution in the jurisdiction in which you are located, and those forms of payment must be linked to a billing address in the same jurisdiction. For most jurisdictions, you must ensure that the billing address on file with the credit or debit card-issuing bank is the same billing address you enter when ordering. We do not accept personal checks, money orders or cash payments online.

Because Under Armour does not charge for items until they ship, we may use a pre-authorization process to reserve your products for shipment. In order to avoid unnecessary overdraft charges, a method called a “pre-authorization” is often used by banks to verify that the credit/debit card in use is valid and has sufficient funds. Please note that the transaction description will show up on your statement as “UNDER ARMOUR.” Most authorizations expire within five to seven days; however, the issuing bank ultimately determines the length of the authorization. The final credit or debit card charge will only reflect the value of your shipped merchandise plus applicable shipping and taxes. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to call our customer service team.

If you are experiencing problems with payment, please contact our customer service team-a member of our team will be happy to assist you.
(g) Delivery and Shipping

There are some locations that we cannot ship to, and we do not ship to post office boxes, so please confirm that we can deliver to you before placing your order.

The estimated delivery time and shipping costs for each order will be presented at checkout. While we make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timelines, delays occasionally occur. <ltd2>Under Armour shall not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver goods within estimated timelines.</ltd2>

Under Armour reserves the right to require goods to be signed for by an adult aged 18 years or over upon delivery. It is not always possible for customers in one jurisdiction to purchase from Under Armour Shopping in another jurisdiction. Please visit our local website to see what stock is currently available to you.

You will generally receive a tracking number via email once your package has been shipped. You can also find your tracking number(s) by logging into your account and entering the Order Number from your order confirmation email to track your package. Please allow two to four business days between placing your order and using the tracking tool.

If you tracked your order on our website and received the message that your order is “in transit”, this simply means that your order is being processed for shipment, or that the tracking information has not yet been updated with the shipping carrier. It typically takes two to four business days for the carrier to receive our tracking information.

We strive to ship all items in an order together, but we reserve the right to deliver your products in separate shipments if one or more items are unavailable at the time of initial shipment. In the event that we split your order into more than one shipment, you will not be charged separate shipping costs for each shipment. Further, each shipment will have a confirmation/tracking email. If we experience an issue fulfilling one part of your order, that will not serve as a basis for canceling any of the other items included in that order.

Any orders that are delivered to you will become your property at the time that you receive them, provided that Under Armour has received full payment for the order.
(h) Cancellations, Exchanges and Refunds

The cancellation, exchange and refund policies and procedures that apply to your order may vary depending on where you are accessing Under Armour Shopping. For additional information about the policies that apply to a particular order, please review the policies listed in the Customer Service and Additional E-Commerce Terms section of the local website that you used to place the order.
