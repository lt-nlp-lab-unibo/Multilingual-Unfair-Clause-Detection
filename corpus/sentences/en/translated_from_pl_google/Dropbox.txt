Dispute resolution
Let's try to come to an agreement first.
We want to address your concerns without having to raise the matter at the formal and legal level.
Before filing a lawsuit against Dropbox, you consent to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at dispute-notice@dropbox.com.
We will try to resolve the dispute informally and by e-mail.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of your request, you have the right to initiate formal proceedings against Dropbox.
Judicial forum for disputes.
You and Dropbox agree that any legal proceedings to resolve a claim relating to these Terms will be brought before the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration rules below.
You and Dropbox consent to submit to the personal and local jurisdiction of such courts.
If you live in the country (e.g.
in one of the Member States of the European Union) whose laws grant consumers the right to settle disputes before a local court, this section does not affect these requirements.
IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION:
Agreement of both parties to arbitration.
You and Dropbox agree to settle any claim in connection with these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth in the Exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement section.
This includes disputes arising out of and relating to the interpretation or application of this Compulsory Arbitration Section, including its enforceability, revocation or validity.
Arbitration Waiver.
You may decline this arbitration agreement by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of your original account registration.
However, if you have accepted an earlier version of these Terms allowing you to opt out of arbitration, your previous decision to opt out or not remain in effect.
Arbitration procedures.
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will conduct its arbitration based on its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Disputes.
The arbitration will take place in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location to which we agree.
Arbitration Fees.
The AAA rules will govern all arbitration fees.
Dropbox will pay all individual arbitration fees for claims less than $ 75,000.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than the offers we made to satisfy your claim, we will pay you $ 1,000 in addition to the award.
Dropbox will not seek reimbursement for its attorneys unless the arbitrator deems the claim to be frivolous.
Exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement.
Both you and Dropbox can make a claim (if they qualify) in a court of
Small Claims in County San Francisco (California) or any county of the United States where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely to secure a claim to stop the unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or infringement of intellectual property (e.g.
trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above.
If the arbitration agreement does not apply to you or your claim, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California to resolve your claim.
NO CLASS ACTION.
You can only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and you cannot bring a claim as a plaintiff or as a member of a class action, consolidated or represented group.
Collective arbitrations, class actions, legal actions representing collective interest and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
If this clause is found impossible to comply with, the entire content of this mandatory arbitration section will be invalid.
Governing Law
These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, except for its conflicts of law.
However, in some countries (including European Union countries) there are laws requiring contracts to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country.
This section does not override these provisions.
Entire Agreement
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of the Terms and shall supersede and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements or terms applicable to that subject.
These conditions do not create any rights for the benefit of third parties.
Waiver, Severability, and Assignment
Dropbox's inability to comply with an order does not waive its right to do so later.
If any provision is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable substitute condition will be established that reflects our intentions as closely as possible.
You may not transfer any rights under these Terms and any such attempt will be void.
Dropbox may transfer its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any business successor associated with the Service.
Changes
We may update these Terms from time to time to better reflect: (a) changes to the law, (b) new legal requirements, or (c) improvements or enhancements to our Services.
If any update affects your use of the Services or your rights as a user of the Services, we will notify you prior to the update becoming effective by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via in-product notification.
Such updated terms will be effective at least 30 days from the date of our notification.
