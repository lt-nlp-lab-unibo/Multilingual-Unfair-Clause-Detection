OUR SERVICES

1.
Western Union's online services include the execution of domestic and international money transfers.
To use the Western Union Online Service, you must be 18 years of age or older and be a resident of Poland.
Each money transfer is tagged with an individual transaction number - a transfer control code or "MTCN".
2.
2.
By providing and consenting to the processing of the information required for the money transfer and by agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, the Sender instructs WUIB to execute a specific money transfer.
Each individual transfer order constitutes a separate agreement between WUIB and the Sender, which is limited to the execution of a specific money transfer.
The framework agreement concluded between you and our company does not oblige us to execute individual and subsequent money transfers.
The sender should properly inform the recipient about the money transfer sent.
2.
3.
Due to statutory and regulatory requirements, we will take appropriate steps to make the transferred funds available to the Recipient at the latest by the end of the business day following the day on which the funds were received ("Receipt Date").
The moment of receiving the funds is the moment when we receive the transferred funds together with the due fees for the transfer.
For money transfers ordered in writing during the period extended by another business day.
2.
4.
In the case of (i) money transfers made outside the EEA or (ii) money transfers where more than one currency is exchanged between the euro and the currency of one of the European Union or EEA member states not belonging to the eurozone, or (iii) money transfers carried out in currencies other than euro, the funds will be available to the Recipient at the latest at the end of the fourth business day from the date of receipt.

Western Union's online service provides a variety of pickup options, including cash pickup at a representative, bank account, or mobile phone where possible.
If the funds are to be transferred in cash, the Recipient should provide appropriate proof of identity along with any transaction details Western Union requires in connection with the receipt of the funds, including, but not limited to, the name of the Sender, the country from which the funds were sent, the name of the Recipient. , the approximate amount of funds being transferred, and any conditions and requirements of the Western Union agent when withdrawing funds, such as
MTCN (money transfer check code).
The payment of the transferred funds to the Recipient will be made after verification of identity documents by Western Union or an authorized representative.
The payment of the transferred funds may also take place when the information provided by the Recipient contains minor errors.
Neither Western Union nor its agents are required to match the Recipient's address information.
In some locations, the Recipient may be asked to provide proof of identity or answer a test question, or both, in order to collect the funds transferred.
The test question must not be used as an additional security measure and must not be used to extend or delay your withdrawal of funds; the use of test questions is prohibited in some countries.
For transfers to a bank account or to a mobile phone, Western Union will make the transfer in accordance with the information provided by the sender.
In the event of inconsistency in the details of the account owner (including mobile phone numbers for mobile phone accounts) and the Recipient's name, the funds will be transferred to the account with the number provided by the Sender.
2.

Applicable law prohibits money remitters from doing business with certain entities and countries; Western Union is required to review all transactions against a list of entities prepared by the governments of the countries and territories with which we do business, including the US Foreign Assets Regulatory Authority (OFAC) and the European Union's.
If the entity is on the list, Western Union performs transaction verification to determine that the entity name is actually on the list.
To this end, Western Union is required to ask the Sender or the designated Recipient for additional information and evidence necessary to delay the transaction.
This is a legal requirement for all Western Union transactions (including money transfers initiated and finalized outside the US).

Transfer Fees: Written information explaining how Western Union charges to the Sender for the execution of a money transfer is available on the Western Union Transaction Website and is available to the Sender when filling out the Transaction Request.
The individual transfer fees for money transfers are listed in the "Send Money Online" section of www.westernunion.com.
Select the name of the destination country, enter the transfer amount, and then click "Calculate".
The sender should pay all fees to perform the transfer, unless the regulations in force in a given country provide otherwise.
In some cases, withdrawals of funds transferred may be subject to local tax laws or require the payment of service fees.
The recipient may therefore be required to pay additional costs related to the withdrawal of funds transferred by the Sender based on the customer's account, to an account on a mobile phone or to a bank account.
Money orders should be sent to the account (Recipient) in the local currency, otherwise the receiving institution (in which the Recipient has an account) may convert the funds at its own exchange rate or even refuse to accept the money transfer.
The agreement between the Recipient and his / her mobile or banking service provider, mWallet or other account operator defines the rights, obligations, fees, availability of funds and account restrictions.
In the event of inconsistency in the details of the account owner (including mobile phone numbers for mobile phone accounts) and the Recipient's name, the funds will be transferred to the account with the number provided by the Sender.
Western Union may charge additional fees for using your account for the purpose of sending and receiving money transfers.
Western Union will not be responsible in any way for costs that the Sender or any account holder has incurred as a result of the currency exchange rate when converting to foreign currencies or the actions or inaction for a particular location or on the part of an internal service provider.
2.
9.
Exchange rates
a.
Money transfers are usually made in the currency of the destination country (in some countries, withdrawals are only possible in an alternate currency).
All currencies are converted by Western Union according to the current exchange rate.
Western Union makes the conversion based on commercially available interbank rates plus a margin.
Most exchange rates fluctuate several times a day in line with the respective rates in effect at the close of global financial markets.
Currency exchange rates for money transfers are available at www.westernunion.com by selecting the name of the destination country in the "Send money online" tab, entering the transfer amount and clicking "Calculate".
b.
The currency will be converted at the time of the transfer and the Recipient will receive the transfer in the local currency for the amount indicated when making the transfer.
In some countries, local laws require that the money transfer amount be converted to your local currency at the time of withdrawal.
If the Sender is transferring funds to one of these countries, the exchange rate stated above is only an estimate, and the actual exchange rate will be determined when paying out the funds.
Western Union representatives may offer Recipients the option of receiving money transfers in a currency other than the one chosen by the Sender.
In such cases, Western Union (or its agents, mobile phone service providers or banking service providers) may charge additional fees to convert the funds sent by the Sender into the currency selected by the Recipient.
If the Sender selects a currency other than that of the destination country, the selected money transfer currency may not be available in all locations within that country, or may not be available in small enough denominations to cover the entire money transfer.
In such cases, the agent may send part of the money transfer made by the Sender in the local currency.
Western Union's exchange rates may be less favorable than some publicly announced market rates used in transactions between banks and other financial institutions.
Any differences between the exchange rates offered to customers and the exchange rates received by Western Union will be added by Western Union (and, in some cases, by their agents, mobile phone service providers or banking service providers) to the money transfer fees.
Additional information on currency exchange rates for specific target countries is available on the toll-free telephone number listed below or on our website.
2.
10.
SMS - Western Union offers a free SMS notification service in selected countries to inform you that a money transfer has been received (for the Sender) and about the availability of funds for withdrawal (for the Recipient).

Western Union is not responsible for any SMS charges.
If permitted by applicable law, an SMS notification will be sent to the number of the Sender and / or Recipient provided during the transaction.
