Information about PayPal and the PayPal service
PayPal's core business is the issuance of electronic money and the provision of payment services using that electronic money.
More information about PayPal can be found in the Essential Payment and Service Information document.

Account opening
PayPal offers two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.
Personal accounts
Using a personal account, the User can send money to friends and family, demand payment from them and pay for online purchases.
For holders of some existing personal accounts, an account extension may be required (which may require additional information to be provided to PayPal) in order to be able to use all the features currently available in the personal account.

Linking and removing a funding source for payments
The money in your account is officially referred to as "electronic money", which means that throughout the European Economic Area it is a form of money suitable for online transactions.
You may use a Funding Source to pay PayPal in order to receive electronic money into your account or to be able to withdraw funds from your account as provided in this User Agreement (see section 6.1.
in particular, the sections titled Adding or Withdrawing Money and Financing Payments).
You can link or remove a credit, debit, prepaid card (where applicable), bank account, or PayPal Credit (where applicable) as a funding source for your PayPal account.
PayPal may limit the availability of funding sources to manage your risk.
Keep up-to-date information on the source of payment financing (e.g.
credit card number and expiry date).
If this information changes, PayPal may update it based on available information and data from external sources without any action on your part.
If you do not want PayPal to update your card details, you can ask your card issuer to do so or remove the funding source from your PayPal account.
If PayPal updates a funding source for your payment, it will retain any preference settings associated with that funding source.
You can choose to confirm your card or bank account number, which allows PayPal to verify that you are the owner of the account and that your card is valid.
You can also do this by following the Card or Bank Account Linking and Confirmation Procedure, or through other procedures that we will make known from PayPal from time to time in notices or publications.
Ongoing consent to credit funding sources provided by you to PayPal
By linking a Funding Source to your PayPal Account, you authorize PayPal indefinitely to automatically debit that Funding Source (subject to the terms of this User Agreement and the terms of the power of attorney used by the payment source issuer to enforce this authorization) for the amount necessary to purchase the money. electronic in the required amount:
to cover the payment amount (and any transaction fees payable to PayPal) when you use your account to send a payment to another user; and
to add funds to the User's account using the Add Funds function.
PayPal may recharge the Funding Source if a previous attempt was unsuccessful.
If you cancel any indefinite consent to debit your funding source, we will refund to us an amount equal to the amount of electronic money spent that remains outstanding on that funding source.
You can revoke this permission by removing the associated funding source from your PayPal account.
The risk of withdrawing payments to the source of financing the User's payment and situations in which electronic checks are used
Upon receipt of a payment from your Funding Source, PayPal may retain the resulting amount in electronic money in your Reserves Account for as long as there are indications that there is a risk that the Funding Provider may reverse the payment.
This is because PayPal does not have all the information necessary to place your payment funds in your PayPal account balance when there is a risk of that payment being reversed.
When you instruct PayPal to make a payment to another user from your bank-financed account, and PayPal holds the amount received in electronic money, that type of payment is called an electronic check.
To find out how we use electronic checks, see the Funding Payments Sent From Your Account section below.
Having and using a PayPal account balance
You will not receive any interest or other gains on the funds held in your account.
This is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law prohibits the payment of interest on electronic money.
Furthermore, under Luxembourg law, electronic money should not be considered a deposit or an investment.
The user is therefore not protected under the Luxembourg Deposit Guarantee Scheme and the investor compensation schemes operated by the Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs.
PayPal may hold your money in one of the following accounts or transfer money between the following accounts:
saldo PayPal; i
reserve account,
at any time as set out later in this Agreement.
Saldo PayPal
The operational part of the account contains the User's PayPal balance, i.e. the balance of funds available for making payments or withdrawals.
When you use PayPal's payment service to send money to another user, you instruct PayPal to transfer the funds from your PayPal account balance to the recipient's account.
You must have sufficient funds in your PayPal account balance to cover the amount of each payment you make and the transaction fees that PayPal collects at the time of payment.
Please see the Making a Payment section below for other applicable requirements.
If you have insufficient funds in your PayPal account or you choose your preferred funding source, you also instruct PayPal to debit funds from that funding source and transfer the appropriate amount of electronic money to your PayPal account balance to complete the requested payment.
When you wish to withdraw money, you must have sufficient balance in your PayPal account to cover the amount of any withdrawal at the time of withdrawal.
To find out how to add funds to your PayPal account balance and withdraw money from your PayPal account, see Adding or Withdrawing Money.
If your PayPal account balance shows a negative amount, it is a net amount owed to PayPal at that time.
Reserve account
Money marked in the account description as "pending", "uncleared", "blocked" or otherwise restricted at any time is kept in the part of the account that acts as a reserve account.
You may not access or use any money held in your Reserve Account.
Adding and withdrawing money
Adding money
In order to receive electronic money on the account, the User may, in accordance with the provisions set out later in this User Agreement:
accept payments from someone else.
PayPal may charge you a fee for this; or
receive electronic money from PayPal upon payment of its equivalent.
You may receive electronic money from PayPal:
by automatically using appropriate funding sources to cover the amount due (and the PayPal transaction fee) that you have commissioned PayPal to send, or
manually, by using the "Add Funds" feature in your account to pay or have PayPal debit your funding source in exchange for e-money.
Your funding source provider is legally responsible for any payments made to PayPal by your funding source provider.
PayPal has no control over how long it takes to process your payment to PayPal.
Withdrawing money
If you have funds in your PayPal account balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to a designated funding source associated with your PayPal account, as may be permitted by PayPal from time to time.
This may be your bank account or your debit or credit card, depending on the country of registration of your PayPal account.
When you instruct PayPal to withdraw any amount from your PayPal account balance, as set out below in this User Agreement, PayPal:
will convert electronic money into money that can be transferred to the designated source of financing of the User's payment; and
will commission its own bank to transfer this money to the designated source of financing of the User's payment.
PayPal tries to send withdrawal requests to its bank by the end of the next business day (
"Business day" means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open for public use) if there are no other delays as set out in this User Agreement.
Once your payment order has been submitted to your bank, PayPal has no control over how long it will take to process that payment to you.
At this point, PayPal's bank, your funding source provider and the payment system they use take responsibility for transferring the money to your designated funding source, and this may affect the timing of your receipt of the money.
PayPal may allow you to withdraw money by transferring it to:
an eligible bank account (if available) via:
a standard transfer to the User's bank account associated with their account (this feature is sometimes known as a transfer to a bank account); or
instant transfer to the bank account associated with the User's account.
PayPal may allow these transfers to be made via the debit card associated with this bank account.
Mastercard or Visa cards (if available).
There are fees for withdrawing funds.
Each time you initiate a withdrawal, PayPal will disclose to you the applicable fees in advance.
The Funding Source (such as a bank account or card) to be withdrawn must be in your Original Account Opening Currency or another currency supported by PayPal in your country of residence.
You may only withdraw funds from your PayPal account balance in the currency of your account opening, unless otherwise specified by PayPal.
To withdraw funds from your PayPal account balance in a different currency, you must convert them into funds in the currency of your account opening.
Otherwise, they will be converted at the time of payout.
The PayPal retail exchange rate will be used.
This means that when withdrawing funds:
from your PayPal account balance in a currency other than the original opening currency, you will be charged a fee for converting the currency into the original opening currency; and
on the source of payment financing (e.g.
bank account or card) in a currency other than the original currency of opening the account, the User will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the source of financing the payment is carried out.
To protect you, other PayPal users and PayPal from loss, and to comply with anti-money laundering and other laws, PayPal may delay a withdrawal in certain circumstances, including where we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal. or when a payment made to your PayPal account is reversed (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal, or buyer dispute).
Where a restriction has been placed on your PayPal account, payment has been blocked, or your account or any linked account shows a balance due in any currency and your PayPal account has a withdrawal pending, you must re-initiate that withdrawal after the restriction is lifted or blockades or settlement of the balance of receivables.
PayPal may impose a withdrawal limit on your account.
You can check your withdrawal limits by logging into your PayPal account.
To raise your Withdrawal Limit, please follow the steps that will be notified by PayPal from time to time in notifications or publications (which may appear in your Account Description).
Managing money in multiple currencies
When an account is opened, it is set up to be used in the currency of the account opening.
The original currency of opening the User's account is Polish zloty (PLN).
PayPal may set up your account so that you can maintain balances and send and receive payments in currencies other than the currency in which you opened your account.
If you have funds in your PayPal account balance, PayPal may allow you to convert the funds into a balance in a different currency.
If there are insufficient funds in your PayPal account balance to cover the amount of the payment requested in a particular currency, PayPal may perform a currency conversion from any other currency in your PayPal account to cover the missing amount.
There may be some restrictions on sending payments in certain currencies.
PayPal may also allow you to choose how your account treats or converts payments received in a currency other than the currency in which your account was opened.
To receive money in a currency other than the currency in which your account was opened, you may need to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds to a different currency that you may have.
Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatically converting money to another currency that the User may have.
If you receive a payment from anyone who does not have a PayPal account and the payment is in a currency for which the account is not set up, PayPal may automatically convert the amount received into the currency for which the account is configured at the time of payment.
Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to find out how you can make withdrawals in different currencies.
If one of the currency balances in your account is owed to PayPal, then PayPal may cover that liability due to PayPal from funds held by you in another currency or withhold the amount due from money received in your account from funds you wish to withdraw or send from your account or to another account, or from funds from any withdrawals you wish to make.
If your PayPal account balance is due to PayPal in a currency other than Euro for 21 days, then PayPal may convert the amount owed to Euro.
PayPal may, in its sole discretion, impose limits on the amount of money that can be converted or the number of currency conversions allowed.
You are responsible for all risks associated with holding funds in multiple currencies in your PayPal account.
You may not manage or convert currencies for speculative purposes, for arbitrage conversion, currency conversion options, or any other activity whose primary purpose (in PayPal's sole discretion) is to earn or earn money based on currency conversion rates.
PayPal may block, cancel or reverse any transactions that it deems violate this policy.
How PayPal converts currency
When PayPal performs a currency conversion, it uses the retail exchange rate specified by PayPal for the currency.
The transaction conversion rate is adjusted regularly to include the fee applied and included by PayPal in the base exchange rate to obtain the rate applicable to the currency conversion.
The base exchange rate is based on the exchange rates on the wholesale currency markets as of the day of the exchange, either on the previous business day or, where required by law, the relevant government exchange rates.
PayPal may provide you with the ability to check the retail exchange rate (inclusive of) at checkout.
If you complete the transaction, the same retail exchange rate may apply to payment for the transaction regardless of when it is processed, or that rate may only be valid if payment for that transaction is processed within a limited period as specified at checkout transaction.
After this limited period, PayPal may use the retail exchange rate in effect at the time of processing the transaction or fail to perform the currency conversion.
If you have authorized a payment under a billing agreement and you choose to convert the currency with PayPal, PayPal will use the retail exchange rate in effect at the time of processing the transaction.
The retail exchange rate for each billing agreement payment may vary.
PayPal may provide you with a "Currency Converter" tool that allows you to see which retail exchange rate (including currency conversion fee) may apply to certain currency conversions.
The rates displayed in the Currency Converter are valid only at the time of using the tool and are subject to change.
Currency conversion options
When your payment source is a debit or credit card and PayPal determines that a currency conversion is required, you allow PayPal to do a currency conversion in place of your debit or credit card issuer.
In the case of card payments, the User may have the right to decide that the conversion of the payment currency into the currency in which the User sends the payment from the PayPal account will be made by the card issuer, if this solution is used by that card issuer.
You may be asked to make this choice in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to,
by indicating the transaction currency, the entity performing the conversion (PayPal or the card issuer) or the conversion rate used for the transaction.
If the card issuer converts the currency, it will specify the currency conversion rate and any fees.
PayPal will always perform currency conversions for transactions financed with your existing balance or linked bank account.
If PayPal determines that a currency conversion is necessary to complete a transaction that also requires the use of a fallback funding source, you may not be able to separately select whether the currency conversion is performed by PayPal or your card issuer for a payment made from a fallback funding source.
If a currency conversion at the time of sale is offered not by PayPal but by a merchant, and you choose to authorize the payment transaction based on the merchant's exchange rate and fees, PayPal will not be responsible for that currency conversion.
Account statements and account data request
Unless restrictions have been placed on your account, you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.
You agree to view your transactions in the Activities tab instead of receiving periodic statements by email.
The most important payment information will be sent to the User by e-mail, and the transaction history will be updated and will be available to the User at any time after logging in to the account.
The user can also download the report in his PayPal account.
It will show all fees incurred and any remaining amounts charged to your PayPal account during the period.
Reports will only be updated and made available if actions have been taken on the PayPal account or any fees have been collected during the period.
The form in which information about transactions will be provided to the User will allow him to store and copy this information unchanged, e.g.
by printing a copy.
PayPal reserves the right to charge you for providing additional information to you or otherwise providing you with transaction history and other information about fees.
You will not be charged a fee for providing you with documents requested in connection with a bona fide suspicion of error in your PayPal account.
Fees
PayPal charges fees for using its services as set out on the fees page.
The fees shown are inclusive of all applicable taxes; however, there may be other taxes or costs that are not paid or charged by PayPal.
You are responsible for paying telephone charges, any charges imposed by your internet service provider, and similar or related charges in connection with your use of PayPal services.
PayPal may charge fees from your PayPal account.
PayPal may levy transaction fees on the amounts transferred before the funds are added to your PayPal account balance.
Details on the amounts received and fees charged can be found in the e-mail sent from PayPal or in the Activities tab (after logging in to the account).
If you are required to pay a fee to PayPal in connection with a payment, PayPal may disclose the amount to you upon receipt of an instruction from you.
You may not withhold or deduct any amount from your fees.
PayPal may charge you for any additional services provided outside of this User Agreement.
The user will be informed about these charges when ordering the services.
If you are a merchant and wish to request (and maintain) a volume-based merchant rate, the terms and conditions for the merchant rate set out in Receiving Payments below apply.
Making a payment
General provisions for making payments
Payment order
PayPal may allow you to submit your payment order by any means which PayPal may notify you from time to time.
The method of transferring the payment order by the User depends on the type of payment being made, for example:
If you are paying for your purchase or making a donation, many vendors or fundraising organizations allow you to submit a payment order to PayPal on their website using a special PayPal checkout button or other integrated PayPal solution.
To send someone money, the User may use the Send Money function after logging in to his PayPal account.
PayPal may ask you to authenticate your order (i.e.
to provide PayPal with the information needed to confirm that the order has actually been transmitted by the User, e.g.
providing correct login details - including e-mail address and password) and successfully logging into your PayPal account in order to submit the payment order.
Payment order cancellation
Once the payment request has been handed over to PayPal, the User may not cancel it.
The exception is payments under the billing agreement (more details below).
How long will my payment take?
Payment to another user will be debited from your account [within one business day] after PayPal has received a complete payment request.
Payment will be debited from the User's account within two business days if the payment order is submitted to PayPal:
on a day that is not a working day; or
on a business day after the following cut-off hours for accounts registered in the following countries: 2 p.m. in Poland.
PayPal may allow you to make a payment at a certain later date.
In this case, the payment will be debited from your account at the aforementioned later date.
Other provisions of this User Agreement may extend the above time frames.
When PayPal May Refuse to Make a Payment
PayPal may treat your payment order as incomplete and may refuse to make a payment if:
You do not have sufficient funds in your PayPal account balance;
there are grounds to believe that the related funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the amount of the payment;
You have not provided PayPal with all the information required as part of the checkout process by which you submit your payment request to PayPal (e.g.
required recipient information and payment order authentication);
the amount of the payment exceeds the sending limit as PayPal informs you when you try to make the payment; or
there is reason to believe that a prohibited activity has occurred in relation to your account or that you have otherwise breached this User Agreement.
When the payment is not accepted by the recipient
If PayPal allows you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can pick up the money by creating a PayPal account.
If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they may not accept the money.
If the recipient does not accept the payment or does not open a PayPal account and does not receive the money within 30 days of sending the money, the money (including any fees charged to you) will be returned to your PayPal account.
To find out what happens when you receive a refund to your PayPal account, see Refunds to your account.
Sending Limits
PayPal may, at its sole discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of your payments, including the payments you send for purchases.
You can check your sending limits by logging into your PayPal account.
To remove your sending limit, please follow the steps that PayPal will periodically announce in notifications or publications (which may appear on the Summary page).
Set up automatic charges from your account
Seller deferred payments
When paying some sellers or for certain purchases (e.g.
for an order that must be shipped or that can be updated and finalized by the seller), the User provides:
authorization to the seller to collect payment at a later date; and
order to PayPal to make an automatic payment when requested by the seller.
An authorization is usually valid for up to 30 days, but can remain valid for longer.
If you have funds in your balance, PayPal may hold the payment amount pending until the seller receives the payment.
If PayPal requires a currency conversion as part of your payment, a retail currency conversion rate will be determined and applied (as described in Currency Conversion) at the time your payment is processed.
This authorization allows the seller to update the payment amount before it is charged (to reflect any changes to the order agreed with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping costs or discounts).
PayPal does not need to review any changes (including at the time of payment) at any time.
PayPal may transfer any amount based on the authorization given by you and the instruction received from the seller for the final payment amount.
Payments under billing agreements
You can manage payments to the same recipients on an ongoing and automatic basis through a billing agreement.
At the time of the conclusion of the billing agreement:
The user authorizes certain recipients to collect payments from his account in accordance with their arrangements (this may apply to the payment of amounts due to the recipient for the purchase of goods or services under a separate agreement concluded with the recipient); and
You instruct PayPal to make payments to the recipients (or other recipients they designate) when PayPal receives such a payment request from them.
This makes the payee a "trusted beneficiary" (a legal term that describes a payee you designate as trusted) for all payments made under that billing agreement.
Therefore, PayPal will not ask for authentication (e.g.
by logging in) or confirming the payment at the time of payment.
Payments made under a billing agreement can be of different amounts and made on different dates.
PayPal is only a payment service provider and therefore cannot know the arrangements between the User and the recipient or the reasons why the recipient decides to collect the payment.
PayPal is under no obligation to verify or confirm the amount provided by the recipient to process a billing agreement payment.
PayPal uses a number of terms in relation to the payments that can be managed under a billing agreement, including "
automatic payments "," subscription payments "," recurring payments "" sample transactions "," "pre-authorized transfers" or "pre-approved payments".
You may cancel your billing agreement at any time and with immediate effect through your account or by contacting PayPal.
In the event that you notify PayPal that you are canceling a billing agreement, and payment is scheduled for that billing agreement before the next business day, PayPal may cancel that billing agreement after such payment has been made.
If the billing agreement is canceled, the User may still owe the recipient money for the goods or services received which he did not pay for.
If PayPal determines and performs a currency conversion, it will use the retail exchange rate (including currency conversion fee) in effect at the time of processing the transaction.
The retail exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.
Refunds to the User's account
In what situations can refunds be made
PayPal may allow the payee to:
refusal to accept a payment; or
accepting it and then using PayPal services to send you a refund of all or part of the payment amount later.
PayPal will refund any declined or refunded payments to your account balance.
PayPal will credit your balance within 30 days of initiating payment.
If any payment amount is reimbursed to you as described above, PayPal may convert the refunded amount into:
the currency of the PayPal balance used to make the original payment (before any currency conversion into the currency received by the recipient);
the original currency of the opening of the User's account; or
US dollars (by opening a balance in that currency, if the User does not have it yet).
If the payment originally sent by you included a currency conversion, PayPal will convert the refund from the currency in which the recipient received the payment as follows:
if the amount is refunded within one day from the date of the original payment, PayPal will use the retail exchange rate used when the original payment was made so that you receive the original amount (including currency conversion fee incurred) in the currency that was converted to send the original payments; and
if the amount is refunded within one day of the original payment, PayPal will use the retail exchange rate used when the refund was converted.
You agree to incur a currency conversion fee for amounts returned as a refund or declined payment.
Unless otherwise stated in the clause above, you agree to pay a currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as a refund or declined payment when you convert the amount refunded to you as described above.
The retail exchange rate may be applied immediately without notice to you.
PayPal may also automatically withdraw the refunded amount from your balance and transfer the funds back to the Funding Source used to make the original payment.
Withdrawals can also involve currency conversion - see the Withdrawing Money section above.
The risk of receiving refunds
Your refund may be lower than the original payment amount.
This can happen in the case of:
the recipient has sent a refund of less than the original payment amount.
As PayPal is only a payment service provider, it cannot know what the refund amount is due to you or why the recipient has sent you the refund amount; or
fluctuations in the retail exchange rate.
PayPal is not responsible for any loss arising from the recipient's decision to decline or refund the payment, unless the refund sent by the recipient is a payment incorrectly made by PayPal.
We are not responsible for any difference between the value of the original payment and the value of any refund due, except where the refund is incorrect (see the Troubleshooting section).
Payment financing
Choosing your preferred funding source
The user can choose the preferred source of financing the payment after logging in to his account.
Subject to the provisions of this User Agreement, your preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments sent from your account.
You can select separate preferred funding sources for certain billing agreement payments.
Special conditions for financing payments
Some payments may be funded by specific funding sources associated with your account, such as a merchant discount, gift certificate, or other promotional funding source.
The use of and prioritization of these specific financing conditions are subject to separate terms and conditions agreed between you and PayPal.
The account summary may display information about a hypothetical amount available under specific financing conditions, from which appropriately indicated payments can be financed at a given time.
This amount is not electronic money, is not considered part of your PayPal account balance, and cannot be used as cash.
It is only the amount of electronic money that PayPal proposes to issue (spend) and credit to your account at the time of execution (and to cover immediately) the qualifying payment, subject to further provisions regarding the use of these specific funding conditions (and only on time). specified in these provisions).
If a payment made by you financed under your specific financing terms is revoked at a later date and for any reason, PayPal will retain the amount that corresponds to the portion of the payment that was financed in accordance with your specific financing terms and (provided that the specific financing terms payments have not expired anymore) will restore the specific financing conditions.
Financing payments sent from your account
PayPal receives electronic money for payments sent from your account from the following sources in the following order and to the extent available:
Special terms of financing payments (if available for the given transaction)

It depends on certain factors, including but not limited to:
The type of purchased goods or services for which the User has received payment; or
The period for the delivery of articles or the provision of services for which the User has received payment (e.g.
Selling event tickets several months in advance may create a higher and more sustained risk of chargeback than selling most other items or services.)

The liability risk for PayPal in connection with any form of your insolvency may continue as long as your insolvency laws prevent PayPal from taking action against you; and

Locks, Restrictions and Reserves
What are Locks, Restrictions, and Reserves?
In some circumstances, to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers who use PayPal's services, PayPal may take action at the account or transaction level.
PayPal will usually notify you when you take any of the actions described herein.
In justified cases (for example, if you have breached this User Agreement or where it is advisable to do so for security reasons), PayPal may, however, take action without prior notice.
Please visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in your restriction, hold, or reserve notice email for information on any restrictions, holdings, and reserves on your account.
You acknowledge and agree that any funds accumulated pursuant to this User Agreement may be placed in your Reserve Account.
You also agree to provide PayPal with any information that it may reasonably require to determine if the risk has ceased to exist.
Blockades
A hold is an action PayPal may take under certain circumstances at the transaction or account level.
When PayPal blocks an amount of a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.
Before blocking a payment, PayPal looks at a number of factors including: account status, transaction activities, type of business, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.
Some common situations in which PayPal will block payments include when you believe that:
The transactions involve a higher risk (for example, where the transaction involves the sale of higher-risk goods or services); there are other known circumstances that usually lead to an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes; or transactions are often fraudulent or illegal activities;
There has been a sudden and unusual change in the sales activity of the PayPal account holder, including an increase in the number of chargebacks, revocations or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;
PayPal account is used in connection with prohibited activities;
The security of the PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised; stolen financial information (bank account or credit card) was used to make the payment; or the transaction was not properly authorized;
You are trying to send or withdraw funds received in a fraudulent manner;
You have not provided PayPal with sufficient information to verify your identity or the identity of your business, or you have a limited history of PayPal sales;
The payment sent to you as a seller has been contested as a payment that must be voided or reversed;
Buyer is requesting a chargeback, revocation, or PayPal Buyer Protection claim in connection with the payment you receive.
The buyer submits a claim as part of the dispute resolution process on the marketplace.
There is a risk of withdrawing funds from the User's account to his source of financing.
There is a risk of liability (for a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risks, see Actions We May Take If You Engage in Any Restricted Activities above).
Payment analysis
Where a potentially high-risk transaction is identified, PayPal reviews the transaction carefully before allowing it to be processed.
This may be because there is reasonable suspicion that the payer's PayPal account is being used in connection with a prohibited activity, or for any other reason determined by PayPal in its sole discretion.
These may include situations where there is a risk of liability (for a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risks, see Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities above).
If we analyze the payment, PayPal may:
execute a payment order initiated by the buyer;
at its sole discretion, impose a restriction on the payer's account immediately after executing such a payment order;
block the payment [on the payer's account]; and / or
notify the payee to delay the delivery of a paid purchase.
This may delay the buyer receiving the purchase.
If the transaction is approved, PayPal will notify the seller and ask him to ship the item.
Otherwise, PayPal may cancel the transaction and refund the funds to your account, unless otherwise required by law.
Any payment that passes the Payment Review Process may be revoked under the terms of this User Agreement and will qualify for Seller Protection as long as it meets the requirements outlined in the Seller Protection Policy.
PayPal will notify you by email or via the Activities tab in your PayPal account.
Only the specific payment is analyzed in the payment screening process, and the process is designed to reduce the risk that PayPal users may receive higher-risk transactions.
Analyzing a payment does not imply any review or review by PayPal of the business, nature or reputation of any party to the payment transaction and should not be construed as prejudicing any reputation.
User-ordered blockades
Certain features of the PayPal system may allow you (both directly and through an entity authorized by you, such as an e-commerce platform where you transact as a seller) to instruct PayPal to block funds (including those from payments received through the system). PayPal) in your Reserves Account.
In this case, the availability status of these funds will be visible on the User's account balance.
The status descriptions may differ depending on the function used to request PayPal to hold funds.
PayPal will release the hold on funds as instructed by you (or an entity authorized to act on your behalf) subject to the provisions of this User Agreement.
Account Restrictions
PayPal imposes restrictions to protect itself and buyers and sellers from illegal activity, increased financial risk, or activity that appears unusual or suspicious.
Restrictions also help PayPal collect the information necessary to maintain your PayPal account.
Restrictions may be imposed on your PayPal account for a variety of reasons, including when there is reason to believe that: Someone may be using your PayPal account without your knowledge; PayPal will then restrict your account for its security and investigate any fraudulent activity.
Someone has used your card or bank account without your consent, for example, when your debit or credit card issuer or your bank informs us.
You are in breach of this User Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policy.
Your sales performance indicates that your PayPal account is at increased risk.
For example: Signs of poor sales performance due to an unexpectedly high volume of claims and chargebacks received; selling new types of products or products that are associated with high costs; or a quick increase in typical sales.
There is a risk of liability (for a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risks, see Actions We May Take If You Engage in Any Restricted Activities above).
We may also restrict your PayPal account to comply with applicable law.
Before the restriction can be lifted, you must resolve any issues with your account.
This usually takes place after providing the requested information to PayPal.
However, if, after providing this information to PayPal, there is a reasonable concern that there is a further risk, PayPal may take steps to protect PayPal and its users, third parties or you from the effects of reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and regulatory risks, and any other obligations.
Reserves
PayPal may reserve a reserve in your PayPal account at any time if it believes that the risk associated with you, your PayPal account, business model or transactions may be high.
When PayPal places a reserve on your PayPal account, this means that all or part of the funds in your PayPal account are held and cannot be withdrawn.
The provision is made to protect the account against the risk of reversing or voiding transactions made, or against any other risk related to your PayPal account or your use of PayPal services.
PayPal makes the decision to set aside an account reserve based on a number of factors, including information obtained from internal sources and third parties.
PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:
Period of activity.
The likelihood of chargebacks in your industry.
Payment processing history with PayPal and with other service providers.
Company and User credit history.
Delivery timescales.
The likelihood of a higher number of returns, chargebacks, claims, or disputes.
There are two types of reserves that PayPal may establish in your account.
One or two reserves may be placed on the account at the same time:
A "rolling reserve" is a reserve for which a percentage of the value of each transaction is blocked and then unblocked in accordance with the agreed schedule.
For example, a rolling reserve may be fixed at 10% and locked for a 90-day renewal period.
This means that 10% of the money received from the sale in 1.
day is blocked, then at 91.
the day unlocked; 10% of the money received from the sale in 2.
day is blocked, then in 92.
on the day unlocked, etc.
Revolving reserves are the most common type of reserves.
A "reserve reserve" is a certain minimum amount that must be available in your account balance at all times.
The minimum reserve may be charged in advance as a one-off payment or on an ongoing basis based on the percentage of sales amounts until the minimum reserve amount is reached, similar to a revolving reserve.
If PayPal places a reserve by blocking funds in your PayPal account, the money will be transferred to your reserve account and marked as "pending" and PayPal will notify you.
If the amount of the provision changes due to a change in risk assessment, PayPal will notify you.
You will take, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of collateral as specified by PayPal.
This may require obtaining all necessary documents and registering any document required by PayPal to strengthen all security measures.

amounts to an incorrect amount, was sent late or to the wrong recipient) or the User has received such a payment.
Security / fraud issue
