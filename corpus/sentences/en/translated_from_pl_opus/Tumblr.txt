[{'translation_text': 'Content and content of the subscriber'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Definitions:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'For the purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term "Content" means a creative expression and includes, inter alia, video and audio material, photos, images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written publications, replies, comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable files, graphics, compositions (defined below) and interactive objects which may be generated, made available or otherwise available in or through services; (2) the term "Subscriber\'s content" means the content transmitted, transmitted or otherwise made available to the services by the subscriber.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The content includes, among other things, the entire content of the subscriber.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Your rights to the contents of the subscriber:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Subscribers retain ownership rights or other applicable rights to the contents of the subscriber, while Tumblr or other companies retain ownership rights or other applicable rights to all content other than the contents of the subscriber.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You retain your ownership of any intellectual property published on Tumblr.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'License for the contents of the subscriber granted to Tumblr:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'When you provide Tumblr with a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free subscription, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (public or otherwise), perform (public or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, inter alia, to ensure compliance with the requirements of any network, device or multimedia through which services are made available) and create derivative works of such a subscription content.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The rights granted under this licence are limited to enabling Tumblr to operate services in accordance with their functionality, improvement and promotion of services and the development of new services.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The reference in this licence to "creating derivative works" is not intended to confer on Tumblr the right to make significant editing changes or to create derived materials.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'But it allows, for example, reblogging that allows Tumblr subscribers to redistribute the content of the subscriber from one Tumblr blog to another in a way that allows them to add their own text or other content before or after the contents of the subscriber.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'When a user transfers his works to Tumblr, he gives us permission to share them in all ways that can be expected of us (e.g. through a blog, RSS sources, Tumblr navigation desktop, etc.).'}]
[{'translation_text': "We're not gonna do anything that surprises the user."}]
[{'translation_text': "Other important information: Tumblr's countless blogs were the source of books, films, albums, brands, etc."}]
[{'translation_text': 'Any royalty or remuneration received for the works of the user belongs, of course, to him entirely.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'It is his work and we are proud to be part of (although small) the achievements of our user.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You also agree that this license includes the right of Tumblr to share all publicly published content with other companies chosen by Tumblr in such a way that they can combine or analyse such content in other media and services.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'An example of the meaning of the phrase "making all the publicly published content available" available to Tumblr\'s distribution or analysis partner will be the licensing of a fire hose, the transfer of all public activities to Tumblr live, such as search engines.'}]
[{'translation_text': "It should also be noted that this license applies even if the user ceases to use services, mainly because of the social nature of the content made available through Tumblr services -- when the user makes something public, others may decide to comment on it, which will make the content part of a social conversation that cannot be deleted later without censoring other people's statements backwards."}]
[{'translation_text': 'One thing you need to consider before publishing content: When you make something publicly available on the Internet, it is virtually impossible to delete all copies of this content.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You also agree to respect the intellectual property rights of other persons and confirm and guarantee that you have all the necessary rights to grant us this license for the entire content of the subscriber you are sending us.'}]
[{'translation_text': "Tumblr may, at its own discretion, add the associated entity's own code to the links published on Tumblr, assuming that the user has not previously attached the associated entity's own code to the relevant link."}]
[{'translation_text': 'Users can opt out of this functionality here.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'User Content License:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'As a Service Subscriber, Tumblr grants a worldwide user a licence for downloading, storing, viewing, displaying, performing, redistribution and creation of content derivatives only in connection with use, and in close compliance with functionality and limitations, services (including paid services as defined below).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This means, for example, that we grant the user a license for reblogging purposes.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Compliance with community principles:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You agree not to violate the Tumblr Social Guidelines.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Complete and delete:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If you disable your account or remove specific parts of the contents of the Tumblr Subscriber, Tumblr will make all reasonable efforts to prevent you from accessing and using this content and, if required by the applicable Privacy Policy, delete your account details or the contents of the Subscriber unless permitted or required by law.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'However, the user confirms this and agrees that: (a) the deleted contents of the subscriber may remain in the buffers or backups for a reasonable period of time and (b) copies or cancellations of the contents of the subscriber may not be completely deleted (e.g.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'because of the nature of reblogging).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You can delete your account here at any time.'}]
7.
[{'translation_text': 'Special provisions for application developers'}]
[{'translation_text': "If you develop software or services on the basis of services or any content, whether using the Tumblr application development interface or not, you agree with the Tumblr application developer's API licence agreement."}]

[{'translation_text': 'Tumblr grants you a license to customize the Tumblr template code to create your own templates to use on the website of your blog (each of them is a "Custom template").'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You may transfer your custom templates to use by other subscribers as a subscriber content.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'However, due to the condition of this license allowing the creation of custom templates, you agree that you will not distribute such custom templates from locations other than those of Tumblr or approved by it without our permission as described in our Social Guidelines .'}]
[{'translation_text': 'It should also be remembered that other subscribers may use custom user templates when they are removed from the distribution, and are hereby granting these subscribers an irrevocable license to use these custom templates.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'In other words, the user can withdraw custom templates and stop their distribution, but subscribers who already use them can still use them.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'Payable services are limited licenses allowing the user to use specific paid aspects of services.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The use of terms such as sales, sale, purchase, acquisition or similar terms refers to the acquisition by the user of a licence for the use of paid services and does not imply the transfer of any rights, title or ownership of any kind.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You may not re-license, resell, transfer or exchange services paid in or outside services except where expressly permitted by the rules of these paid services.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Tumblr can, at its sole discretion, modify or eliminate the functionality of paid services; this also applies to the terms and conditions under which the paid services are made available.'}]
[{'translation_text': "Purchases of paid services are final and non-refundable (in particular those paid services that can be used immediately, such as promotions as defined below), with the exception of Tumblr's own discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each paid service."}]
[{'translation_text': 'The closure of an account or the expiry of rights under this Agreement may result in the loss of purchased paid services.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'For example, if your account is suspended, it loses its license to use any Premium templates purchased.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Tumblr can change the prices of paid services at any time.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Within the permitted framework, Tumblr will provide the user with a reasonable notification of any such price changes by publishing new prices in or through the relevant paid services or by sending an e-mail with a notification.'}]
