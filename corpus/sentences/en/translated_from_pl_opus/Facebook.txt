[{'translation_text': "We give users the opportunity to express their views and move things that are important to them: Facebook gives them a lot of opportunities to express themselves and talk to friends, family and other people about what's important to you, for example by sharing status changes, photos, videos and relationships in all Facebook products you use, send messages to your friends, create events or groups, or add materials to your profile."}]
[{'translation_text': 'We have also developed and continue to develop new ways for users to use technology, e.g.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'expanded reality or 360 movies to enable them to create and share more interesting and expressive content on Facebook.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We help users discover content, products and services that they might be interested in: We show users advertising, offers and other sponsored materials to make it easier for them to find content, products and services offered by many companies and organizations using Facebook and other Facebook products.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This is explained in more detail in section 2 below.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We fight cases of harmful activities and protect and support our community: Users create a community on Facebook only if they feel safe.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We employ special teams around the world and develop advanced technical systems to detect cases of misuse of our Products, harmful actions against others and situations where we can help support or protect our community.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If we find out about this type of content or actions, we will take appropriate steps, for example we will offer help, remove the content, block access to certain functions, block the account or notify law enforcement authorities.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We share data with other Facebook companies if a person using one of our Products finds misuse or harm.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We use and develop advanced technologies in order to provide safe and functional services to everyone: We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and expanded reality, so that users can safely use our products regardless of their physical capabilities or geographical location.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'Facebook Ireland Limited or their related entities.'}]
2.
[{'translation_text': 'Financing of our services'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Instead of paying for the use of Facebook and other products and services that we offer by using Facebook products covered by these Terms and Conditions, you agree that Facebook should display advertisements for which we are paid by companies and organizations to promote in and outside Facebook products.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We use personal data of users, such as information about their activities and interests, to display advertising to users that are more interesting to them.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Protecting the privacy of users of the website is a key element of the functioning of our advertising system.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This allows us to display accurate and useful ads to users without providing advertisers with information about them.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We do not sell personal data to users.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We allow advertisers to provide us with information such as their business purpose and the type of group of customers they want to display advertisements (for example, people aged 18-35 who like cycling).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Then we display their advertising to people who might be interested in it.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We also provide advertisers with reports on the effectiveness of advertising, which will make it easier for them to see how the recipients react to their content on Facebook and beyond.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'For example, we provide advertisers with general demographic information and information about interests (for example, that advertising was displayed by a woman in many 25 to 34 years who lives in Madrid and is interested in computer science) to help them understand their audiences.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We do not share information that allows you to identify directly (such as your name or email address that allows you to contact or determine who you are) without your explicit consent.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You can find more information about how ads work on Facebook here.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We collect and use your personal data to provide them with the services described above.'}]
