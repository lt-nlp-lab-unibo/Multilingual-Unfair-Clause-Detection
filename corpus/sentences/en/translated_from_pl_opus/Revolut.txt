[{'translation_text': 'The exchange rate may change between the moment you inform us of the intention to change the currency and the moment at which we actually make the exchange.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This means that if you ask us for a currency change, you may receive a slightly larger or smaller amount than you expect.'}]
[{'translation_text': "We are not liable if: you lose any money as a result of currency conversion; or there will be a charge on any fees or you will lose any money because you use the Revolut card in another country and ask the seller (or the seller's bank) to make the conversion (Imagine that you are e.g."}]
[{'translation_text': "you are a Lithuanian customer and traveling around Japan when you pay your account at a restaurant, you agree to be paid in euro and not in yen; that means you are asking the seller's bank to convert the currency, and we are not liable if this bank gives you a worse exchange rate or charges)."}]

[{'translation_text': 'Payment and payment of funds and account supply'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This chapter sets out how your money will automatically be transferred between your demand deposit account in Revolut Bank and your e-money account whenever a payment is made from or received from your e-money account (other than your demand deposit account in Revolut Bank or from that account).'}]
[{'translation_text': "What's gonna happen to my money so far?"}]
[{'translation_text': 'Once you accept this Complement and register with Revolut Bank, we will transfer the existing balance of your e-money account in Revolut Payments to your demand deposit account in Revolut Bank.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This means that by accepting this Supplement you order us to transfer the existing balance of your electronic money account to your Revolutionary Bank deposit account as described in this Supplement.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'What happens if I get paid?'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Whenever you or someone else sends money to your e-money account, we will transfer it to your online deposit account at Revolut Bank.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This applies to each account supply case (as described in section 12 of the Personal Account Regulations).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We will implement these transfers as soon as possible (and as soon as possible immediately).'}]

[{'translation_text': 'The money sent to your Revolutionary Bank deposit account will be held by Revolut Bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Revolutionary Bank deposits accepted by you.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Money will not be stored by us (except when you send it through your e-money account).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'What happens if I send money or make a payment?'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Whenever you send money using the Revolut app (e.g. an external bank account), you pay a fee for the Revolut service (e.g.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'a monthly fee for a Metal plan or an insurance premium) or you make any kind of payment using Revolut (e.g.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'via direct debit, payment link or any other method), you order us to immediately send a debit request to Revolut Bank asking you to withdraw funds from your deposit on demand account equal to the amount needed to make the payment.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'After sending the requested amount from your deposit account upon request to your e-money account, we will immediately release the electronic money to you and then immediately withdraw it to the recipient in accordance with the Personal Account Terms and Conditions.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'However, this money will remain in your e-money account for a short time, until they are paid to the card system.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Since money has already been spent, it will not be available for re-release.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'As you can see, when you send or spend money, they will be in your e-money account for a very limited period of time, from the moment you leave your demand deposit account at Revolut Bank until they are paid out.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'What happens if I fund my account?'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You can still power your account as described in section 12 of the Personal Account Regulations.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Whenever you do this, we will treat the added money as much as any other money sent to your account, as described in the "What happens if I receive a payment" item?'}]
[{'translation_text': 'above.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You can also still use the automatic power function described in section 12 of the Personal Account Regulations.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Whenever your rememberable deposit balance in Revolut Bank falls below the amount set by you, the automatic power function will add money to your account in a normal way. ('}]
[{'translation_text': 'In chapter 3 below, we described what your "remembered balance" is.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'What happens if I make the exchange?'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Whenever you ask us to exchange currency using the Revolut application, you order us to immediately send a debit request to Revolut Bank to collect funds from your deposit on demand account equal to the amount needed to make the exchange.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'If you make a payment that needs to be converted in accordance with the Personal Account Regulations (e.g.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'What does my account balance and transaction history show?'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We are tracking all funds transferred between your online deposit account at Revolut Bank and your electronic money account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Using this information, we remember for you the balance of your deposit account on demand at Revolut Bank.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The balance that we show in the Revolut app is the sum of your "remembered" deposit account balance in Revolut Bank and the available balance in your e-money account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'We use this balance because these two amounts taken together reflect the total amount you can spend.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'It is also a balance that we provide through our Open Banking API when you use access to your account via a licensed external provider.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'To make sure that the information we are showing you is correct, you agree that we are entitled to receive information from Revolut Bank about your deposit account on demand (including information about any locks or restrictions on your deposit account on demand and their reasons).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You also agree that we can send the same information about your e-money account to Revolut Bank.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The transaction history displayed in Revolut will include all payments made and received by you.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'However, in order to maintain simplicity, we do not show automatic transactions between your online deposit account and your electronic money account as described in point 2 on the transaction history screen.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Instead, this information is displayed in transaction confirmation statements.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If, for example,'}]
[{'translation_text': 'you will spend EUR 5 using the Revolut card in the store, you will see the purchase in the store on the transaction history screen, but you will not see the associated automatic transaction from the deposit on demand account to an electronic money account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You can request us to list automatic transactions, but by accepting this Supplement you agree that these transactions will not be made available on the transaction history screen in Revolut or through push notifications.'}]
