[{'translation_text': 'The exchange rate of the transaction is regularly adjusted and includes the fee applied and included by PayPal in the basic exchange rate in order to obtain the exchange rate applicable to the currency conversion in question.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The basic exchange rate shall be determined on the basis of the exchange rates on the wholesale exchange markets of the day on which the exchange takes place, either on the preceding working day or, if required by law, on the basis of the relevant exchange rates fixed by the State administration.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PayPal may provide you with the opportunity to check the retail exchange rate (including) during the execution of the transaction.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If you complete the transaction, the same retail exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction regardless of when it is processed, or this rate may be valid only if the payment for the transaction is processed within a limited period, as specified during the execution of the transaction.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'After this limited period, PayPal may use the retail exchange rate in force at the time of transaction processing or may not convert the currency.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If you authorised a payment under a settlement agreement and chose to convert the currency into PayPal, PayPal will apply the retail exchange rate in force at the time of transaction processing.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'You may be asked to make such a choice in different forms, including, among others,'}]
[{'translation_text': 'by indicating the currency of the transaction, the conversion entity (PayPal or card issuer) or the conversion rate used for the transaction.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'In the case of conversion of the currency by the issuer of the card, it shall determine the conversion rate of the currency and possible fees.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PayPal will always convert currencies in the case of transactions financed by an existing balance or a related bank account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If PayPal finds that currency conversion is necessary for the execution of a transaction that also requires the use of a reserve source of payment financing, you may not be able to make a separate choice as to whether PayPal will convert the currency or card issuer in case of payment made from a reserve source of financing.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If the conversion of currency at the time of sale is offered not by PayPal, but by the trader, and the User decides to authorize the payment transaction on the basis of the exchange rate and fees specified by the trader, PayPal will not be responsible for this conversion of the currency.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'The PayPal account is used for prohibited activities;'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The security of the PayPal account participating in the transaction may have been compromised; stolen financial information (account or credit card) has been used for payment; or the transaction has not been properly authorised;'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The user tries to send or withdraw funds received unfairly;'}]
[{'translation_text': "You have not provided PayPal with sufficient information to verify your company's identity or identity, or you have limited sales history in PayPal;"}]

[{'translation_text': 'Payment analysis'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If a potentially high-risk transaction is found, PayPal will carefully analyse it before allowing it to be processed.'}]
[{'translation_text': "This may be due to a reasonable suspicion that the payer's PayPal account is used in connection with prohibited activities or for other reasons defined by PayPal at its discretion."}]
[{'translation_text': 'These may include situations where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risks can be found in the Action section that PayPal may take in case of your consent to activities prohibited above).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'In case of payment analysis, PayPal may:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;'}]

[{'translation_text': 'PayPal will notify you via email or the Action tab on your PayPal account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'In the process of examining payments, only a specific payment is analysed and this process aims to reduce the risks associated with receiving high-risk transactions by users of PayPal.'}]
[{'translation_text': "The submission of payment analysis does not imply a review or opinion of PayPal's commercial activities, the nature or reputation of any of the parties to the payment transaction and should not be understood as violating anyone's good name."}]
[{'translation_text': 'Locks commissioned by the User'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Some features of PayPal may enable you (both directly and through an entity authorised by you, such as an e-commerce platform where you enter into transactions as a seller) to order PayPal to block funds (including those from payments received via PayPal) in your reserve account.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'Status descriptions may vary depending on the function used to order PayPal to block funds.'}]

[{'translation_text': 'The restrictions also help PayPal collect the information needed to maintain your PayPal account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Restrictions can be imposed on your PayPal account for various reasons, including when there is reason to believe that: Someone can use your PayPal account without your knowledge; PayPal will then limit your account for your safety and investigate unfair actions.'}]
[{'translation_text': "Someone used the User's credit card or bank account without his consent, for example, when the issuer of the debit or credit card or your bank informs us about this."}]
[{'translation_text': 'You have violated the provisions of this Agreement with you or the Conditions of Acceptable Use.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Your sales results indicate that your PayPal account is subject to increased risks.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'For example: signs of weak sales results due to unexpectedly large number of claims received and drawbacks; sales of new types of products or products that involve high costs; or rapid increase in typical sales.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risks can be found in the Action section PayPal can take in case of user consent to prohibited activities above).'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PayPal may also limit your PayPal account to comply with applicable law.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Before you can remove the restriction, you must solve any problems with your account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This is usually done after PayPal has provided the requested information.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'However, if there is a legitimate fear of further risks after the information is provided to PayPal, PayPal may take action to protect PayPal and its users, third parties or users from the consequences of withdrawals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and regulatory risks and any other obligations.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Reserves'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PayPal may reserve your PayPal account at any time if you consider the risks associated with you, your PayPal account, business model or transactions to be high.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'When PayPal establishes a reserve in your PayPal account, it means that all or part of the funds in your PayPal account are blocked and cannot be paid out.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The reserve shall be set up to protect the account against the risk of withdrawal or cancellation of transactions made, or any other risk associated with your PayPal account or its use of PayPal services.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PayPal decides to establish a reserve in your account on the basis of many factors, including information obtained from internal sources and from external entities.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PayPal takes into account the list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Period of operation.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The likely occurrence of a sector-specific feedback burden.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The history of payment processing in PayPal and other service providers.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Credit history of the company and the User.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Time frame for deliveries.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The likelihood of a higher number of returns, drawbacks, claims or disputes.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'There are two types of reserves that PayPal can establish in your account.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'At the same time one or two reserves may be established in the account:'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The renewable reserve is a reserve where the percentage of the value of each transaction is blocked and then unlocked in accordance with the agreed timetable.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'For example, the renewable reserve can be set at 10% and blocked for a 90-day renewal period.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This means that 10% of the money received from sales in 1.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'the day is blocked and then in 91.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'day unlocked; 10% of the money received from sales in 2.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'the day is blocked, then in 92.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'day unlocked, etc.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'Renewable reserves are the most common type of reserves.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The minimum reserve is a certain minimum amount that must be available on your account at all times.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'The minimum reserve may be charged in advance on a one-off payment or on a continuous basis on the basis of the percentage of sales until the minimum reserve is reached, as in the case of the renewable reserve.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If PayPal establishes a reserve by blocking the funds in your PayPal account, the money will be transferred to your reserve account and marked as a waiting account and PayPal will inform you of this fact.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'If the amount of the reserve changes due to changes in the risk assessment, PayPal will notify you of this fact.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'You will take at your own expense any further action required to set up a reserve or other form of security as specified by PayPal.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'This may involve obtaining all necessary documents and registering any document required by PayPal in order to strengthen any security.'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PROBLEM SOLUTION'}]
[{'translation_text': 'PayPal recommends that you regularly monitor your account.'}]
