The rights that the user grants in this license are deemed to have been granted in order to allow Tumblr to provide the Services according to their functionality, to improve them, to advertise them and to develop new ones.
In this license, the reference to "create derivative works" should not be understood as granting Tumblr a right to make substantial editorial changes or derivations but, for example, to allow re-blogging, which allows Tumblr Subscribers to redistribute Subscriber Content from a Tumblr blog to another blog, in a way that allows them to add text or other Content before or immediately after the Subscriber Content.
