This article must be interpreted broadly and remains valid even after the termination of this Agreement.

Your arbitration fees and arbitrator's compensation share are governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.

The arbitration may be conducted in person, by submitting documents, by telephone or online.
The arbitrator will make his decision in writing and provide a statement containing the reasons for the verdict, if requested by either party.
The arbitrator must abide by the laws in force, otherwise any verdict may be challenged.

Limits
YOU AND EA AGREE THAT BOTH MAY MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY TO THE LIMIT OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS CIVIL PARTIES OR MEMBER OF A CLASS IN A CLASS ACTION OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE PROCEDURE.

Place

pay you 150% of the arbitrator's compensation, up to $ 5,000 in addition to the compensation itself; as well as
