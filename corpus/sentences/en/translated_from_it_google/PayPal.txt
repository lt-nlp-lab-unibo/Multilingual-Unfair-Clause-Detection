Normal practice may create a safety risk or a substantial technical, economic or material burden.
Link and unlink a payment method
Money in your account in legal terms is defined as "electronic money" and is recognized in the European Economic Area as a form of money that can be used for online transactions.
You can use a payment method to pay PayPal and obtain e-money in your account or to receive transfers from your account, as further described in these Terms of Use (see in particular Top up your account or transfer money and Fund payment ).
You can link or disconnect from your PayPal account, as a payment method, a credit, debit or prepaid card (where available), a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available).
PayPal may limit the availability of payment methods as part of its risk management.
The user should keep their payment method details (e.g. credit card number and expiration date) up-to-date.
If this data changes, PayPal may update it using the information and third-party sources it has available without involving the user.
If you do not want PayPal to update your card details, you can contact the issuing company to request it or to remove the payment method from your PayPal account.
If PayPal updates the user's payment method, it will retain any preference settings linked to that method.
The user can choose to confirm the card or bank account to allow PayPal to verify that they are valid and that the user is the effective owner.
PayPal allows the user to confirm the data through the "connection and confirmation" procedure (for cards) or the "bank account confirmation" procedure (for bank accounts), as well as through other procedures that PayPal can communicate to user or publish if necessary.
Continuous authorization to PayPal to charge the user's payment methods
By linking a payment method to your PayPal account, you authorize PayPal to automatically debit / credit the connected payment method on an ongoing basis (pursuant to these Terms of Use and the terms of any mandate, e.g.
direct bank debit, used by the service provider of the payment method in question to dispose and maintain such authorization) of the requested e-money value:
To cover the payment amount (plus any transaction fees payable to PayPal) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.
To top up the user's account when the user uses the "Top up Account" feature in the account interface.
PayPal may resort to the payment method again if the previous attempt was unsuccessful.
The user who cancels a continuous authorization from their payment method is required to reimburse PayPal for any amount in e-money already paid by PayPal but not yet paid with the payment method in question.
The user can revoke the authorization by disconnecting the payment method from their PayPal account.
SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and the European banking industry, created to make transactions within the European Union more efficient.
Whenever you link a bank account to your PayPal account or use a new bank account for the first time as a payment method, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit Mandate.
If you are using a SEPA direct debit mandate for ongoing authorization:
You can access the mandate and its mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.
PayPal will notify the user of the amount of payment by SEPA Direct Debit and the days required for the amount to be credited to PayPal from the bank account together with the confirmation of the purchase.
Should PayPal resubmit a payment request via SEPA direct debit due to the cancellation of the initial payment, no (additional) information will be given on the amount and the new expected times.
You can request a refund from your bank at any time up to eight weeks after the SEPA direct debit payment date, subject to the bank's terms and conditions.
Risk of chargebacks on the payment method used and eCheck use cases
When you use a payment method, PayPal may keep the corresponding e-money in a reserve account for as long as it has reason to believe that there is a risk of cancellation by the payment method provider.
This situation occurs because PayPal does not have all the information necessary to credit the payment money into the user's PayPal balance as long as there is such a risk of reversal.
When the user asks PayPal to make a payment from his account to that of another user by financing it from his bank account and PayPal keeps the electronic money deriving from the transaction in the manner described above, the type of payment from the user's bank account is called "eCheck".
See the Funding Payments Sent from Your Account section below to learn how PayPal uses eChecks.
Own and use a PayPal Balance
You will not receive interest or other fees on the money in your account, as this money is electronic and European law prohibits you from paying interest on electronic money.
Furthermore, electronic money is neither a deposit nor an investment within the meaning of Luxembourg law, therefore the deposit guarantee in Luxembourg or the investor compensation schemes operated by the Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs cannot protect you.
PayPal may hold and transfer money to your account in and between:
The PayPal Balance e
The reserve account
at any time under these Terms of Use.
Saldo PayPal
The operational part of the user's account contains the PayPal balance, which is the balance of the money available for payments or transfers.
When you use the PayPal payment service to pay another user, PayPal undertakes to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient's account.
At the time of payment, you must have a sufficient PayPal balance to cover the amount of the payment made and the fees due for the transaction.
Other requirements also apply - see the Making Payments section below.
If you do not have sufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred payment method, you can also request PayPal to obtain money in your name from the applicable payment method and to issue e-money to your PayPal balance in order to make the payment.
When transferring the money, the user must have sufficient PayPal balance to cover the amount they wish to transfer.
See Top up your account or transfer money to learn how to get a PayPal balance and how to transfer it.
If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, it is the net amount owed to PayPal at that time.
Reserve account
Money marked on the main account page as "pending", "not executed", "blocked" or otherwise restricted at any given time is held in the account area which acts as a reserve account.
The user cannot access or use the money in the reserve account.
Top up your account or transfer money
Top up your account
To have electronic money on your account, the user can, pursuant to these Terms of Use:
Accepting payments to your account from other people.
In this case, PayPal may charge fees.
Obtain electronic money by paying PayPal an equivalent amount.
You can get e-money from PayPal:
Automatically, using applicable payment methods to cover payment amounts you ask PayPal to send to other users (and transaction fees payable to PayPal).
Manually, using the "Top up account" function available in the account interface to pay PayPal an amount in electronic money or to ask PayPal to debit the payment method linked to the account.
The execution of any payment to PayPal by the payment method provider is the legal responsibility of the provider.
PayPal has no control over the time it takes to complete the payment.
Transfer money
If you have a PayPal balance, you can withdraw an amount and transfer it to the payment method linked to your PayPal account, subject to approval from time to time obtained by PayPal.
The linked payment method to transfer the amount to can be a bank account or a credit or debit card, depending on the country in which the user's PayPal account is registered.
When you ask PayPal to transfer an amount from your balance under these Terms of Use, PayPal may:
Convert e-money into cash to be transferred to the designated payment method.
Instruct your bank to transfer such money to your designated payment method.
PayPal agrees to send the transfer payment instructions to its bank by the end of the next business day ("business day" means a day on which Luxembourg banks are open to the public) if no other delays occur under the these Terms of Use.
Once the bank receives these instructions, PayPal will have no control over the time it takes to complete the payment.
At this point, it will be the PayPal bank, the provider of the user's payment method and the payment systems on which they are based that will assume the responsibility of transferring the money to the designated payment method and all of this can affect the time it takes for the actual crediting of the money.
PayPal may allow you to transfer money by sending it to
An eligible bank account (where PayPal permits) via:
A standard transfer to the bank account linked to the user's account (this transfer / redemption functionality is sometimes referred to as a "bank transfer").
A direct debit to the bank account linked to the user's account.
PayPal may allow the above transfers to be made via the debit card linked to the relevant bank account.
Your Mastercard or Visa credit card (if available).
Fees apply to transfers.
In addition, PayPal will communicate the rates in advance each time the user initiates a transfer.
The payment method (for example, bank account or card) to which the user requests the transfer must be denominated in the original currency of the account opening or in another currency supported by PayPal for transfers to the country of residence of the 'user.
You can only transfer your PayPal balance in your account opening currency, unless otherwise agreed.
In order to transfer an amount from a PayPal balance to another currency, the user will need to convert that balance to the opening currency of their account or the conversion will take place automatically at the time of the transfer.
PayPal will use its own exchange rate for the transaction.
This means that if the user transfers money:
to a PayPal balance in a currency other than the original account opening currency, the conversion into that currency will be done using the PayPal transaction exchange rate;
to a payment method (for example, a bank account or card) that has a different currency than the original account opening currency, the conversion into the currency of the payment method will be done using the PayPal transaction exchange rate.
The issuing company may also charge you an amount if a currency conversion to the currency in which the card was issued is required.
If the user has a Business account, this exchange rate does not apply.
Instead, you will be charged a currency conversion fee applied to an external exchange rate, as described on the rates page (see also the "How to convert PayPal currencies" section).
To protect you, other PayPal users and PayPal itself from loss, as well as to enable us to comply with anti-money laundering regulations and comply with other legal obligations, PayPal may delay a transfer in certain situations, including when necessary. verify that the user has authorized the transfer or that payments to the user's PayPal account are subject to reversal (for example, following a chargeback, bank reversal, or a dispute from a buyer).
If a restriction is applied to your PayPal account or if a payment is blocked or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a transfer from your PayPal account is pending, the the user will have to carry out the transfer again after the restriction or block has been removed or after having fully repaid the negative balance.
PayPal may set limits on transfers and the user will be able to see them by logging into their PayPal account.
To remove the transfer limit, the user must follow the procedure that PayPal will communicate or publish periodically (the notification may be shown on the main page of the account).
Manage money in different currencies
Upon opening, the account is configured to be used with its opening currency.
The opening currency of the user's account is the euro (EUR).
The user can set the currency on their card.
PayPal can configure the account to allow the user to also use it to deposit money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the one in which the account was opened.
PayPal may allow an account holder to convert their balance into another currency.
If your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount of a payment ordered in a specific currency, PayPal can perform a currency conversion from a PayPal balance to another currency to cover the missing amount.
Sending payments in certain currencies may be restricted in some countries.
PayPal may also allow you to choose how payments received on your account in currencies other than the original opening currency are handled and / or converted.
To receive money in a currency other than the one in which the account was opened, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or to convert the money into another currency that PayPal allows the user to hold.
Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatically converting money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.
If you receive a payment from someone who does not have a PayPal account and that payment is made in a currency that your current account setup does not allow you to use, PayPal may automatically convert the amount received into a currency supported by the account at at the time of payment.
For information on how to transfer in different currencies, see the section on Transferring Money above.
If one of the balances in the user's account currency presents, for any reason, an amount owed to PayPal, PayPal may decide to offset this amount by using the money present in the balance in another currency of the user or by deducting it from the amounts received on the your account or any amounts that you try to transfer or send from your account or another account, as well as by deducting the amount from any transfer you try to make.
If for a period of 21 days your PayPal balance reflects an amount owed to PayPal that is not expressed in euros (EUR), PayPal can convert the amount owed into euros (EUR).
At its discretion, PayPal may impose limits on the amount of money the user can convert or the number of conversions they can perform.
You are responsible for all risks associated with having multiple currencies on a PayPal account.
You may not manage or convert currencies for speculative purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal deems primarily aimed at earning money by taking advantage of currency conversion rates.
PayPal can block, cancel or reverse any transaction that violates these rules.
PayPal currency conversion methods
Except as provided below and on the rates page, in the event of a currency conversion by PayPal, this will be completed at the transaction exchange rate established by PayPal for the conversion in question.
The transaction exchange rate is adjusted periodically, typically between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) (in New York City, United States) every business day.
These changes take effect immediately.
The user can access the "Currency Converter" tool to find out the transaction exchange rate applicable to certain currency conversions.
The exchange rates displayed by the "Currency Converter" indicate the rates applicable at the time the instrument is used and may vary.
Pursuant to the other provisions of the Terms of Use, when you complete a transaction, you will be shown the exchange rate of the transaction so that you can decide whether to pay at the rate indicated.
In certain circumstances, the transaction exchange rate may be applied to the payment for the transaction regardless of when the payment is processed or only if the seller has processed the transaction within a certain period, as indicated prior to the transaction.
At the end of this period, PayPal may use the exchange rate in effect at the time the seller processes the transaction or may refuse to perform the currency conversion.
If the user has authorized a payment under an automatic debit agreement or if PayPal is unable to communicate with the user when the user authorizes a payment in person (for example, due to lack of connectivity by you or the seller at that time) and currency conversion is used for that payment, PayPal will use the exchange rate in effect at the time the seller processes the transaction.
The transaction exchange rate for payments under the automatic debit agreement or in the event that PayPal was unable to communicate with the customer when the customer authorized a payment in person, may therefore vary from time to time.
If the user is a seller and has agreed to pay the exchange rate of the transaction in place of the buyer or if the user has a Business account and performs a currency conversion on the PayPal account that is not part of a specific transaction from or on the account (for example, by converting the balance to another currency), the exchange rate of the transaction does not apply.
Instead, the user will pay a currency conversion fee applied to an external exchange rate, as described on the rates page.
The external exchange rate depends on the rates set by the global markets on the day of conversion or the previous business day.
Currency conversion options
When the payment is from a credit or debit card and PayPal determines that a currency conversion is required, you agree and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of the credit or debit card company.
If provided by the card issuer and its network, the user can have the card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency of the PayPal account used by the user to send the payment.
This choice can be presented to the user in various ways, including configuring the card currency, the ability to choose which currency to make the transaction, who to make the conversion (PayPal or the card issuer) or which conversion rate is applied to the transaction.
If the card issuer converts the currency, the card company will determine the currency conversion rate and any fees to be charged.
PayPal will always convert for transactions where the user uses the existing balance or linked bank account as a payment method.
If PayPal determines that a currency conversion is required to perform a transaction that also requires a back-up payment method, you may not be able to decide who between PayPal or the card issuer will perform the currency conversion for. the payment made with the reserve payment method.
If the currency conversion is proposed at a point of sale by the seller and not by PayPal, and the user decides to authorize the payment transaction based on the rates and exchange rate charged by the seller, PayPal assumes no responsibility for such conversion. currency.
Account statements and requests for accounting documents
Unless restricted, the user can log into their PayPal account to view and download the statement.
Instead of receiving periodic account statements via email, you agree to check your transactions by viewing your PayPal account history.
The main details of the payments will be sent to the user via email and the transaction history will also be updated and made available to the user who can consult it at any time by logging into their account.
The user can also access a downloadable report from their PayPal account.
The report shows all rates and any other amounts charged to the user's PayPal account during the specified period.
The report will be updated and made available only in the event that tariffs have been applied or transactions have been carried out on the user's PayPal account during the specified period.
The method by which PayPal provides transaction information will allow the user to keep and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.
PayPal reserves the right to charge a fee if it provides you with additional information or transaction history and other rate information by an alternative method, but no amount will be charged for the data requested following a good faith statement. of an error on the PayPal account.
Rates
The rates applied by PayPal on its services are indicated on the rates page.
The rates shown include all applicable taxes, but there may be other taxes or costs that are not paid through or are not imposed by PayPal.
The costs of telephone and Internet services requested by the user's provider and the costs of other similar or associated services deriving from the use of PayPal's services are borne by the user.
PayPal may deduct its fees from the user's PayPal balance.
PayPal may deduct its transaction fees directly from the amounts it transfers before crediting the user's PayPal balance.
All information on the amounts credited and the fees charged will be communicated to the user via email or entered in the transaction history (which the user can consult by logging into the account).
If a payment requires the payment of a fee to PayPal, you will be notified when you provide payment instructions to PayPal.
The user cannot discount or deduct amounts from the PayPal fees.
PayPal may charge you for any other service provided to you outside of these Terms of Use.
The charges will be communicated to the user when requesting these services.
If you are a seller and wish to claim (and maintain) the volume-staggered merchant rate, the applicable terms are those of the merchant rate set out below in the Receiving Payments section.
Make a payment
General provisions for making a payment
Payment instruction of the user
PayPal may allow the user to send a payment instruction using the different methods that will be communicated from time to time.
How the user can send a payment instruction may depend on the type of payment to be made, for example:
To pay for a purchase or make a donation, many sellers and / or fundraising entities or individuals allow users to instruct PayPal for payment through a dedicated PayPal Checkout or by integrating another PayPal payment collection method on their sites.
To send a payment to someone, the user can log into their PayPal account and use the "Send money" function.
PayPal may require the user to authenticate the payment instruction (i.e. provide the data necessary to ensure that the user himself gives the instruction, for example by sending his / her correct access data including the email address and password) and to otherwise log into your PayPal account to provide PayPal with the payment instruction.
To speed up the payment process, PayPal offers the user the possibility to select some recipients to make them "trusted beneficiaries" of pre-authorized payments.
To make this type of payment, as a rule, the user does not need to log in to their PayPal account (with password, PIN or other).
The user can of course access the list of trusted beneficiaries in his PayPal account and modify it at any time.
Cancellation of a payment instruction
Once sent to PayPal, a payment instruction can no longer be canceled unless it is subject to an automatic debit agreement (see further details below).
How long does a payment take?
Payments between PayPal users depart from the payer's account within the business day following the date of receipt of the completed payment instruction.
Payment will start from the user's account within 2 working days following the date of receipt of the complete payment instructions if this occurs:
On a day that is not working.
After 4pm on a business day.
PayPal may allow you to request payment on a specified date in the future, and if so, the money will be transferred from your account on the specified date.
The times indicated above may be delayed following the application of other clauses of these Terms of Use.
Cases in which PayPal can refuse to make a payment
PayPal may consider the payment instruction incomplete and refuse to make the payment if:
Your PayPal balance does not cover the payment amount.
PayPal has reason to believe that linked payment methods do not have enough money to cover the payment amount.
The user has not provided all the mandatory data requested during the payment procedures that PayPal uses to accept the user's payment instructions (for example, sufficient information about the recipient that PayPal could request and authentication of the user's payment instruction ).
The payment exceeds the sending limit communicated by PayPal to the user when the latter tries to make the payment.
PayPal has reason to believe that any prohibited activity involving your account has been performed, or that your account has violated these Terms of Use.
Cases where the payment is not accepted by the recipient
A PayPal user can send a payment to a recipient who does not have a PayPal account, but that recipient must open a PayPal account to collect the money.
The recipient who already has a PayPal account can refuse to accept the money.
If the recipient refuses to accept the money or does not open a PayPal account and does not request the money within 30 days from the date of sending, the money (including any costs charged) will be credited back to the user's account.
See Account Refunds to find out what can happen when you receive a refund to your PayPal account.
Sending limits
At its discretion, PayPal may impose limits on the amount and value of payments that you can make, including those related to your purchases.
The user can view any sending limits by logging into their PayPal account.
To remove the sending limit, the user must follow the procedure communicated to him by PayPal or published from time to time (and possibly reported on the main page of the user's account).
Set up automatic debits to your account
Seller delayed payments
When the user pays for certain sellers or certain purchases (for example, purchases that must be shipped to him or can be updated and finalized by the seller):
Authorize the seller to collect the payment at a later time.
Instructs PayPal to automatically pay the seller when the seller requests it.
The user's authorization typically remains valid for 30 days, but may last longer.
If the user has a positive balance, PayPal can withhold the payment amount on that balance until the seller collects it.
If the payment requires a currency conversion by PayPal, the exchange rate for the transaction will be established and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.
Your authorization allows the seller to update the payment amount before collecting it (to reflect any changes made to the purchase and agreed between the seller and the user, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges, or discounts).
PayPal is never asked to check for any changes (not even when payment is made).
PayPal may transfer any amount based on your authorization and upon receipt of the seller's instructions on the final payment amount.
Payments by automatic debit
The user can use an automatic debit to manage recurring payments to be made to the same recipient.
When the user enters into an automatic debit agreement:
to. It authorizes designated recipients to collect payments from your account on dates determined by them (payments may refer to amounts due for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract between you and the recipient).
b. Instructs and authorizes PayPal to pay Designated Recipients (or other recipients designated by the Designated Recipient) when such recipients request PayPal to make payment.
The recipient will thus become a "trusted beneficiary" of all payments that the user makes in his favor and for this reason the user will not always be forced to access the PayPal account (with password, PIN or other) to approve recurring payments at expected deadlines.
Payments made under the automatic debit agreement may have varying amounts and may be sent on various dates.
PayPal is only a payment service provider, so it cannot know what the user has established in their agreements with the recipient or why the recipient has decided to collect the payment, nor should we expect otherwise.
PayPal is under no obligation to verify or confirm the amount requested by the recipient for the purpose of processing payments made under the automatic debit agreement.
PayPal uses different names for payments that may be required by an automatic debit agreement, including "automatic payments", "subscription payments", "recurring payments", "referral transactions", "pre-authorized transfers" or "pre-authorized payments. ".
You can cancel an automatic debit agreement at any time via your account interface or by contacting PayPal.
If a payment under the automatic billing agreement is due before the end of the next business day following the cancellation request, PayPal may decide to cancel the agreement only after that payment has been made.
When you cancel an automatic billing agreement, you may still be indebted to the recipient for goods or services received but not yet paid for.
If PayPal determines that an automatic debit requires a currency conversion and performs it, PayPal will apply the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment is processed.
The exchange rate may vary for each payment transaction.
Refunds to the account
How refunds are made
PayPal may allow the recipient of your payment to:
Refuse to accept it.
Decide to accept it and then use the PayPal service to send the user a refund of the entire amount or part of it at a later time.
PayPal will credit the amount of the refused or refunded payments to the user's balance.
PayPal will credit the amount of unclaimed payments to your balance within 30 days from the date the payment was made.
If a payment amount is returned to you in any of the ways above, PayPal can convert the returned amount into one of the following currencies:
In the currency of the balance used for the initial payment (before any conversion was made to the currency received by the recipient).
In the user's original account opening currency.

PayPal may be forced to compensate the buyer if the buyer claims that there was a problem with the payment (including cases where the payment was not authorized or was incorrect, or when an unexpected payment was made subject to a payment agreement. automatic debit).
To do this, refer to the Troubleshooting section.

Rates for the dispute
PayPal will charge sellers a dispute fee to facilitate the online dispute resolution process for transactions processed through a buyer's PayPal account or through the "Payments Without PayPal Account" service.
The dispute fee applies when the buyer files a complaint directly with PayPal or requests a chargeback from their card company or a chargeback from their bank.
The dispute fee will be charged as a standard dispute fee or as a high volume dispute fee.
The fee for the dispute will be charged in the currency selected by the user in the list of those available for the original transaction.
If the transaction was made in a currency not listed in the dispute fee table, the fee will be charged in the currency of the user's main account.
The dispute fee will be deducted from your PayPal account after the complaint is resolved.
The amount of the dispute fee will be determined at the time the dispute is created.
The rate depends on the ratio of all complaints for Item Not Received and Significantly Not as Described that the user received and the total amount of sales recorded by the user in the last quarter (dispute report).
Total complaints include all Item Not Received and Significantly Not as Described complaints that are forwarded to PayPal either directly or through buyers' card issuing companies or banks.
Total complaints do not include "Unauthorized Transaction" complaints.
For example, for a dispute opened in September, the dispute ratio is calculated by considering the ratio between the total complaints received and the total sales occurred in the months of June, July and August.
The September Complaint Rate will determine the dispute rate applicable to all complaints filed in October.
If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you have performed more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three months, the high-volume dispute rate will apply for each dispute.
Otherwise, disputes will be subject to the standard dispute rate.
Disputes that:
Requests are forwarded to the PayPal Resolution Center and not converted into a PayPal complaint.
They have been resolved directly between you and the buyer and are not converted into a complaint with PayPal.
They were presented directly by the buyer to PayPal as unauthorized transactions.
at PayPal's sole discretion, they meet all PayPal Seller Protection Program requirements.
are complaints related to a transaction with a value less than twice the amount of the standard dispute fee.
They have been resolved in your favor by PayPal or your issuing company.
Disputes that:
Requests are forwarded to the PayPal Resolution Center and not converted into a PayPal complaint.
They have been resolved directly between you and the buyer and are not converted into a complaint with PayPal.
were presented directly by the buyer to PayPal as unauthorized transactions.
Sellers charged with High Volume Dispute Fees may be required to provide information to PayPal including the cause of the increase in their dispute rate.
Even if neither the standard dispute rate nor the high volume dispute rate is applied to the complaints listed above, the complaint can still be included in the overall dispute ratio calculation.
Chargeback fees
For transactions that are not processed through a buyer's PayPal account or through the "Pay without PayPal Account" service, where the buyer tries to obtain a chargeback for the transaction at the card issuer, PayPal will charge the user for the chargeback fees in order to facilitate the chargeback process.
These charges will apply regardless of whether the buyer's attempt to obtain the chargeback against the card issuer is successful or unsuccessful.
Applicable chargeback fees will be deducted from your PayPal account.
Chargeback fees are applied as specified in the chargeback fees table and are charged in the currency selected by the user in the available currency list for the original transaction.
If the transaction was made in a currency not listed in the chargeback fee table, the fee will be charged in the currency of the user's main account.
Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on Sellers
You must read the PayPal Buyer Protection provisions and, if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you must also know the PayPal Buyer Protection applicable to buyers in each affected country, as the rights of the buyers anticipated by individual programs can impact sellers.

For example, agents selling event tickets or online travel agents will lose the full purchase amount paid by the buyer.
In some cases, the item may not be returned to the user.
Claims under Buyer Protection are considered fully resolved only if:
the refund to the buyer is processed through PayPal, or
you provide PayPal with proof it deems acceptable, in its sole discretion, that the buyer has accepted the alternative resolution offered.
You will not be entitled to any refund of the PayPal fees paid in connection with the sale.
If the complaint was about receiving an item that was noticeably not as described, the item may typically not be returned to you or the user may be required to accept the return of the item and pay the return charges.
If the claim was for an item received significantly not as described as sold by the user and found to be counterfeit, the user will be required to refund the full purchase price to the buyer and it is possible that the item will not be returned to them.
If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services sold through eBay, you must read and understand eBay's Money Back Guarantee program.
Unless you have decided to unsubscribe from the program by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as the basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.
If the balance of the Cash account or the PayPal Business account is not sufficient to cover the amount, PayPal can:
Proceed to block your PayPal account until it has enough money to cover the amount.
Create a negative balance on the user's PayPal account.

There is a sudden and abnormal change in the sales activity of a PayPal account holder, resulting in an increase in the number of chargebacks, cancellations or complaints received on their PayPal account.
A PayPal account is used in connection with prohibited activities.
A PayPal account involved in the transaction has been compromised or stolen financial data (bank account or credit card) is being used to make payments or a transaction has not been properly authorized.
A user tries to send or transfer money received fraudulently.
A user has not provided sufficient information for PayPal to verify his identity or that of his business and / or that the user's transaction history with PayPal is limited.
A payment sent to you as a seller is contested as a payment to be canceled and reversed.
A buyer has filed a chargeback, reversal, or claim under PayPal Buyer Protection for a payment that you received.
The buyer files a claim under the marketplace termination process.
There is a risk of money being written off in the user's account to the chosen payment method.
There is a risk of attribution of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of this risk can be found in the Actions that PayPal can take if you engage in prohibited activities above).
Payment review
When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, it carefully reviews it before approving it.
This procedure is implemented in cases where PayPal, in its reasonable discretion, has a reasonable suspicion that the buyer's account is being used for prohibited activities or for other reasons.
This includes cases where there is a risk of liability attribution (a non-exhaustive list of examples of this risk can be found in the Actions that PayPal can take if you engage in prohibited activities above).
If a payment is subject to review, PayPal may:
Execute the payment order sent by the buyer.
Restrict, at its discretion, the payer's account immediately after the execution of the order.
Proceed to block the payment.
Advise the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchased item through payment.
This may delay the receipt of an item purchased by you as a buyer.
If PayPal authorizes the transaction, it will notify the seller of this decision and invite the seller to ship the item.
If PayPal does not authorize the transaction, it will be canceled and the money returned to you, unless PayPal has a legal obligation to take other action.
All payments that pass the review stage are still subject to reversal in accordance with these Terms of Use, but may be eligible for the PayPal Seller Protection program if they meet the requirements.
PayPal will notify you by email and / or in the "History" section of your PayPal account.
The subject of a payment review is solely the payment itself.
The review is done to reduce the likelihood of PayPal users becoming involved in high-risk transactions.
Reviewing a payment is not a check or a statement by PayPal about the reputation, business or business characteristics of any party to the payment transaction and should not be considered a disrespect for any person.
Blocks due to user instructions
Certain PayPal features may allow you (either directly or through someone authorized to act on your behalf, such as an online marketplace platform on which you make sales transactions) to authorize PayPal to block your money (including payment proceeds received using PayPal) into your reserve account.
In this case, PayPal will show the user the status of the availability of the money blocked in his balance; the description of the status may vary depending on the functionality used by the user to instruct PayPal to block.
PayPal will release the amount based on instructions received from you (or from the entity that you have authorized to act on your behalf), in accordance with the remainder of these Terms of Use.
Account Limitations
The limitations are applied to protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when PayPal detects prohibited activity, increased financial risk, or seemingly unusual or suspicious activity.
The restrictions also help PayPal collect the data necessary to keep your PayPal account open.
There are several reasons why restrictions may apply to a user's PayPal account, including when PayPal has reason to believe that:
Someone is using the PayPal account without the user's knowledge, in which case the restriction is necessary for security reasons and to investigate the alleged fraudulent activity.
Someone has used your card or bank account without your authorization, for example, where this is reported to PayPal by your bank or credit or debit card company.
You have violated these Terms of Use or the Acceptable Use Policy.
Your performance as a seller indicates that your PayPal account is at high risk.
Some examples: signs of poor sales performance resulting from the unusually high number of complaints and chargebacks; selling a completely new or very expensive type of product; rapid increase in the usual sales volume.
There is a risk of attribution of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of this risk can be found in the Actions that PayPal can take if you engage in prohibited activities above).
PayPal may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable laws.
Before a restriction can be removed, you will need to resolve any issues you have encountered with your account.
Typically, the restriction is removed after the user has provided the requested information.
However, if after receiving the requested information, PayPal believes that there is still a risk, it is possible that it decides to take steps to protect itself, other users, third parties or the user himself from chargebacks, tariffs, penalties, penalties, risks. legal and / or regulatory and any other attribution of responsibility.
Reserves
PayPal may make a reservation on an account at any time if it believes there is a high level of risk associated with you, your account, your business model or your transactions.
When a reserve is applied to a PayPal account, the money in the account, in whole or in part, becomes unavailable for transfer, to avoid the risk of any transactions made by the user being reversed or canceled, as well as any other related risk. to your account and your use of PayPal services.
Decisions made by PayPal about whether to apply a reservation depend on a number of factors, including information made available to PayPal from internal sources or third parties.
PayPal takes into account a number of non-exclusive factors and assesses whether and how those factors have changed over time, including:
The years of activity of the user.
If the industry in which the user operates is at high risk of chargeback.
Your payment processing history with PayPal and other vendors.
Your personal financial reputation and / or your business.
The user's delivery times.
If the user has a higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, complaints or disputes.
There are two types of reservations that apply separately or simultaneously to PayPal accounts:
The "Renewable reserve" provides that a percentage of the amount of each transaction received each day is blocked and then released at a later time according to pre-established times.
For example, the reserve can be set at 10% and blocked for a period of 90 days: this means that 10% of the money received on the 1st day is blocked and then released on the 91st day, 10% of the money received on the 2nd day. it is blocked until the 92nd day and so on.
Renewable Reserve is the most common type of reserve.
The "Minimum Reserve" is a specific minimum amount that the user must keep available on their balance at all times.
The minimum reserve is retained as an advance amount deposited in a single solution (also called advance reserve) or it is established dynamically, similarly to the renewable reserve, accumulating a percentage of the amount of each sale until the minimum share is reached. pre-established.
If PayPal applies a reserve to a PayPal account, the money will be transferred to the user's reserve account and will be "pending".
The user will be notified of this.
You will also be notified if PayPal changes the type of reserve based on a change in its risk assessment.
You will take, at your own expense, any further action reasonably required to set a reservation or other form of guarantee in the manner deemed reasonably appropriate by PayPal.
This includes signing all necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by PayPal to complete any form of warranty.
TROUBLESHOOTING
The user is strongly advised to check their account regularly and carefully.
If the user encounters a problem ...

Payment for unexpected automatic debit

Contact PayPal in the first place to report the problem (specifying the type of problem in question so that PayPal can intervene as quickly as possible).
You must provide all information on the circumstances of the problem that PayPal reasonably requests and take all measures indicated to facilitate the investigation.
If the user reports the problem verbally, PayPal may also request to report it in writing within the next 10 working days.
PayPal may communicate to third parties the information it deems relevant in such circumstances, based on the provisions of the Privacy Policy.
What PayPal will do to help you ...
In accordance with the rest of these Terms of Use, PayPal's intent is to investigate the issue and work with you to resolve the matter within 60 days.

It will compensate the user as soon as possible (and in any case no later than the end of the business day following the communication of the problem) by restoring his account to the state in which it would have been if the incorrect payment had been sent in the correct way specified by the sender.
This means that:
If the incorrect payment has resulted in the user having less money than they would have had if the payment had been made as ordered, PayPal will credit the difference to the account.
If the incorrect payment has resulted in you having more money than you would have had if the payment had been made as indicated, PayPal may debit the difference from your account.
It will make a refund to your account for any loss or damage directly, reasonably and foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.
An unauthorized payment to another PayPal account, PayPal will return as soon as possible (and in any case no later than the end of the business day following the communication of the problem) the user's account to the state in which it would have been if the error occurred payment had never taken place.
This procedure can also provide for the reimbursement of the payment to the user.
In which cases PayPal cannot compensate the user ...
As indicated above, the user is not entitled to any compensation from PayPal and must return any compensation already obtained by PayPal (which PayPal may cancel from the user's account) if:
You fail to provide PayPal with all information reasonably requested regarding the circumstances of the problem (including failure to submit the required written notification within 10 business days of any verbal reporting of the problem by you).
You fail to take all reasonable steps required by PayPal to support the investigation.
PayPal can prove that you have acted fraudulently.
PayPal can demonstrate that the problem occurred for reasons beyond its control (such as a fire, flood, or loss of Internet connection), despite reasonable precautions being taken.

Payment for unexpected automatic debit
Wrong payment
Unauthorized payment

PayPal can prove that you have provided incorrect payment details.
PayPal can prove that the payment was sent as and when specified and requested by the buyer.
For a reason not attributable to PayPal, the user did not have sufficient balance to complete the payment.
PayPal can demonstrate that their system was not functioning properly and that the user was aware of the disruption when the transaction was performed.
A delay that you believe to be the cause of an incorrect payment is actually due to PayPal applying a block, restriction or reservation under these Terms of Use.
The user reports the problem to PayPal after more than 13 months from the day of execution of the payment.
PayPal can prove that the payment was made because you have intentionally failed to protect the security of your account or through gross negligence (for example, you have recklessly chosen to share your PayPal ID, password or PIN with other people ).
Another type of security / fraud issue has occurred that the user did not report to PayPal.
PayPal will not reimburse any unauthorized payments made from your account prior to reporting the issue.
Sometimes the problem may be detected by PayPal first.
To alert the user of a problem, PayPal uses the Message Center, which the user can consult by logging into their account.
If it is necessary for the user to act promptly, PayPal can also use other communication channels, such as email, to solicit his intervention.
