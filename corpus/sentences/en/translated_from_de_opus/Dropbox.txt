Resolution of disputes
Amicable settlement – ​​We would like to resolve your problems with Dropbox without the involvement of a court.
Before filing a lawsuit against Dropbox, please first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute‑notice@dropbox.com.
We will endeavor to resolve the dispute informally via email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of being raised, you or Dropbox may initiate a formal proceeding.
Venue – You and Dropbox agree that any legal action relating to any claim brought against these Terms and Conditions will be brought in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, in accordance with the mandatory arbitration provisions below.
Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and jurisdiction in such courts.
If you reside in a country (e.g. EU member states) whose laws give consumers the right to bring legal proceedings in a local court, this paragraph does not affect these requirements.
IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:
Arbitration Agreement - Customer and Dropbox agree to resolve all claims relating to these Terms or the Services, except for the situations discussed under “Exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement,” through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator.
This includes any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its enforceability, revocability or validity.
Non-Consent to Arbitration Agreement – ​​You may indicate your non-consent to this Arbitration Agreement by clicking here and submitting the non-consent form there within 30 days of registering your account.
However, if you agreed to a prior version of these Terms and Conditions that gave you the option to opt out of the arbitration agreement, your prior election will remain binding.
Arbitration Procedure - The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will arbitrate under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration shall be conducted in the United States in the county in which you reside or work, San Francisco (CA), or another agreed location.
Arbitration Fees and Bonuses – The AAA decision also governs all arbitration fees payable.
Dropbox will cover all arbitration fees for individuals for claims less than $75,000.
If arbitration is in your favor and better than any offer we make to you to resolve the dispute, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the arbitration award.
Dropbox will not seek attorney's fees in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claim is frivolous.
Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement - You or Dropbox may, subject to the terms and conditions met, bring an action in the Small Claims Court in San Francisco (CA) or another U.S. county where you reside or work.
Either party may bring an action seeking injunctive relief to prevent unauthorized use or misuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement without the informal notice process described above.
If the arbitration agreement does not apply to you or your claim, you consent to the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, as exclusive venue for the resolution of the dispute.
NO CLASS ACTIONS – You may only resolve disputes with Dropbox on an individual basis and may not bring a class, consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not permitted.
If this paragraph is unenforceable, the entire “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” paragraph will be ineffective.
Applicable Law
These Terms are governed by California law, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
Some countries (including EU countries) have laws that require contracts and agreements to be governed by the local laws in the consumer's country.
This paragraph does not take precedence over these laws.
Entire agreement
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements regarding such subject matter.
These terms and conditions do not grant any rights in favor of third parties.
Waiver of rights, severability clause and transfer of rights
Dropbox's failure to enforce a clause does not mean that it cannot be enforced at a later date.
If a clause is found to be invalid, the validity of the remaining terms and conditions will remain unaffected and will be replaced by an enforceable condition that largely corresponds to our intentions.
The rights granted under these Terms are non-transferable and any attempt to do so is void.
Dropbox may assign its rights or those of its contractors or subsidiaries to any successor in interest of any entity related to our Services.
Changes
We reserve the right to revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect: (a) changes in the law, (b) new legal requirements, or (c) improvements or enhancements to our Services.
If a change affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we will notify you prior to the effective date of the change by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or by displaying a corresponding message in the product itself.
The effective date of the updated Terms will be at least 30 days after the date of notification.
If you do not agree to the changes, you must terminate your account before they take effect.
Where applicable, we will provide you with a pro rata refund of the amount prepaid for the Services, taking into account your cancellation date.
By continuing to use the Services after the changes become effective, you agree to the changed Terms and Conditions.
