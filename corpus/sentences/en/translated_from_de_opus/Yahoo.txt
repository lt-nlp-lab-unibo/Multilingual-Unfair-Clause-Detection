THE PARTIES AGREE THAT WITHOUT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL.
YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT IN SOME CASES THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION MAY EXCEED THE COSTS OF GOING TO COURT AND THAT THE RIGHT TO DISCOVER EVIDENCE IN ARBITRATION MAY BE MORE LIMITED THAN IN COURT.
In addition, both parties agree that:
Reporting disputes.

This must be done in writing at least 30 days before the initiation of arbitration proceedings.
The notification to us must be made by letter: Yahoo, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, USA; or email disputes@yahooinc.com.

Comparison offers.
We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before or during arbitration.
The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes an award.

Severability clause.
If any provisions of this Arbitration Agreement are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the Agreement to the extent necessary to replace the unenforceable portions and the parties will arbitrate their disputes without reference to or reliance on the unenforceable provisions.
However, if the class action waiver set forth in Subsection 14.1.f below is unenforceable for any reason as to any or all of the Dispute, the Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or any part of the Dispute.
