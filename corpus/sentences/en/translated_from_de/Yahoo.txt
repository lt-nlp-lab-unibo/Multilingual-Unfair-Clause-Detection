This must be done in writing at least 30 days before the arbitration begins.
Notice to us must be sent by letter to: Yahoo, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or email disputes@yahooinc.com.
The notification to you will be sent to your e-mail address(es) and address(es) (if available), which we have at the time of the notification.

However, if you are an individual using the Services for personal or household use, the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules apply (except for rules and procedures governing/permitting class actions). .
You can obtain information about the process, including the procedure for initiating arbitration, rules and fees, from the AAA at (www.adr.org).

Alternative jurisdiction for small claims.
As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court in your state of residence (or in Santa Clara County, California for corporations) or in Santa Clara County, California, to the extent the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the court minor requirements are met.
Place of Arbitration.
Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration or small claims court proceeding must be held/held in your primary US state of residence or in Santa Clara County, California.
Arbitration Fees and Expenses.
We will refund any filing fees that the AAA charges you for the arbitration of the Dispute.
If you provide us with written and signed notice that you cannot afford the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA.
If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees later charged.
comparative offers.
We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before or during the arbitration.

Severability Clause.
If any provision of this Agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will amend the Agreement to the extent necessary to replace the unenforceable provision, and the parties will arbitrate their disputes without reference to or reference to the unenforceable provision.
However, if the class action waiver set forth in Subsection 14.2.c below is unenforceable for any reason as to any portion or all of the Dispute, the Agreement to Arbitrate shall not apply to that Dispute or portion of the Dispute.
Any dispute affected by a class action waiver that is deemed unenforceable may be litigated only in a competent jurisdiction.
The agreements on the arbitration procedure remain unaffected and in force.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties exclude class arbitration or arbitration for the assertion of claims by third parties.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR US USERS.

YOU AND WE UNLIMITEDLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY A JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING AND COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO COMMENCE A COURT PROCEEDING.
YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION MAY EXCEED THE COSTS OF A COURT PROCEEDING IN SOME CASES, AND THAT THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE EVIDENCE IN ARBITRATION MAY BE MORE LIMITED THAN IN COURT.

Notice of Disputes.
If you or we intend to initiate arbitration under these Terms and Conditions, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute.
This must be done in writing at least 30 days before the arbitration begins.
Notice to us must be sent by letter to: Yahoo, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or email disputes@yahooinc.com.
The notification to you will be sent to your e-mail address(es) and address(es) (if available), which we have at the time of the notification.
The notice must state the nature of the claim and the compensation sought.
If the dispute cannot be resolved within 30 days, either party has the right to initiate arbitration.
arbitration.
The Federal Arbitration Act of the USA applies to these GTC.
Except for matters for which the Small Claims Court has jurisdiction, all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (AAA).
The AAA will use the Commercial Arbitration Rules to arbitrate disputes related to these Terms.
However, if you are an individual using the Services for personal or household use, the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules apply (except for rules and procedures governing/permitting class actions). .
You can obtain information about the process, including the procedure for initiating arbitration, rules and fees, from the AAA at (www.adr.org).
These Terms and Conditions govern to the extent that they do not conflict with the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.
Alternative of the court for small claims.
As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court in your state of residence (or in Santa Clara County, California for corporations) or in Santa Clara County, California, to the extent the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the court minor requirements are met.
Place of Arbitration.
Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration or small claims court proceeding must be held/held in your primary US state of residence or in Santa Clara County, California.
Arbitration Fees and Expenses.
We will refund any filing fees that the AAA charges you for the arbitration of the Dispute.
If you provide us with written and signed notice that you cannot afford the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA.
If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees later charged.
comparative offers.
We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before or during the arbitration.
The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until the arbitrator has made an award.
If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you a payment that exceeds our offer but is less than $5,000, we agree that: (a) we will pay an amount of $5,000 in lieu of the lower award , (b) we will reimburse your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and (c) we will reimburse any filing fees and arbitrator's fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute.
If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we do not contest the award, we will pay you the money awarded.
Severability Clause.
If any provision of this Agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will amend the Agreement to the extent necessary to replace the unenforceable portions, and the parties will arbitrate their disputes without reference to or reference to the unenforceable provision.
However, if the class action waiver set forth in Subsection 14.1.f below is unenforceable for any reason as to any portion or all of the Dispute, the Agreement to Arbitrate shall not apply to such Dispute or any portion of the Dispute.
Any dispute affected by a class action waiver deemed unenforceable may be heard only in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The agreements on the arbitration procedure remain unaffected and in force.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties exclude class arbitration or arbitration for the assertion of claims by third parties.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

YOU AND YAHOO UNLIMITEDLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, AND COUNTERCLAIM ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TOS.
