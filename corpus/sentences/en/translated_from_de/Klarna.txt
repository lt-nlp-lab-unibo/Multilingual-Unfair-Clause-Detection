Description of Services
For us, shopping isn't just about finding and paying for great stuff - it's also about enjoying a great shopping experience at your favorite store, a state-of-the-art app, and many other benefits.
In short: a smooth user experience, both before and after you have made your purchases.
These Terms explain in more detail what that means.
Please note that if you decide to pay with one of the payment methods offered by Klarna, additional conditions may apply to the payment method you have chosen.
1. Autofill and preferred settings
In order for you to have a smooth and seamless shopping experience, we will remember some information about you and use this information to automatically fill in various input fields with your information during your purchase.
This allows you to save time and focus on more important things than filling out the same information over and over again.
Let's explain in more detail how this works.
Autofill by entering limited information
When interacting with Klarna, we may ask for information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, email, date of birth or personal identification number.
We will store this information in our systems so that when you return to us or use our service you will only need to provide some of this information such as email and zip code or personal identification number (depending on the country) for us to fill in the rest of the fields automatically fill in with your other information.
Autofill by a Klarna cookie
Another way to automatically fill in your data is to place a Klarna cookie on your device (computer, tablet, mobile phone, etc.).
You can store your data such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail, date of birth and card details with Klarna.
If you do this, we use the cookie to automatically fill in this data when you shop with Klarna.
For more information about the use of cookies, see our statement on Klarna's use of tracking technologies in the eStore checkout.
Disable autofill
If you do not wish to use the autofill features, you can contact us and we will disable them.
You can also disable this in the Klarna app or by adjusting your Autofill settings during the checkout process.
You can delete all cookies on your device at any time, which will also delete our cookie.
Automatically fill out when shopping directly from the Klarna app
If you're shopping directly from the Klarna app, we can also automatically fill in your details on the page you're shopping on.
This is made possible because you are logged into the app and we know it is you who is shopping.
Pre-selection of preferred payment methods
To make your shopping experience even smoother, Klarna may pre-select what we believe to be your preferred payment method, based on your purchase history.
You can also access other forms of payment if you prefer to switch to a different form of payment than the one we have chosen.
2. Klarna App
The Klarna App, made available to you as an app or web portal, is your online shopping assistant, being your hub for all your Klarna purchases and all of Klarna's other great features.
