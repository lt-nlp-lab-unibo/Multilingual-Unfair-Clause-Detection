Permissions You Grant to Facebook
You must grant certain permissions to allow Facebook to provide our services:
Permissions to Use Content You Create and Share: Some content you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
You own the intellectual property rights (such as copyrights or trademarks) in the content you create and share on Facebook and the other products of the Facebook companies you use.
Nothing in these Terms deprives you of the rights you have in relation to your content.
The user is free to share their content with anyone, anywhere they want.
However, you must grant Facebook, in order to provide its services, certain legal permissions (known as "licenses") to use the content in question.
This is done for the sole purpose of providing and improving Facebook Products and Services, as described in Section 1 above.
Specifically, when you share, post or upload content protected by intellectual property rights in or in connection with the Facebook Products, you grant a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free license valid in throughout the world for the transmission, use, distribution, modification, performance, copying, public performance or display, translation and creation of derivative works of its contents (subject to privacy and settings of the user's app).
This implies, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you authorize Facebook to store it, copy it and share it with other parties (always respecting your settings), such as service providers who support the service or other Products of Facebook that the user uses.
This license ceases to exist once your content is deleted from Facebook's systems.
You may delete content individually or collectively by deleting your account.
Learn more about how to delete your account.

immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in these cases, the contents will be deleted within a maximum of 90 days from the date of deletion by the user);
your content has been used by other users in compliance with this license and has not been deleted (in which case, this license will continue to apply until the content is deleted); or
where immediate deletion would limit Facebook's ability to:
detect or investigate illegal activities or violations of Facebook's terms and policies (e.g.,
identify or investigate misuse of Facebook Products or systems);
comply with an obligation under the law, such as preserving evidence; or
comply with a request from judicial or administrative authorities, law enforcement or government agencies.
In these cases, the contents will be retained for no longer than is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were stored (the exact duration will vary depending on the situation).
In each of the above cases, the license will continue to exist until the contents are completely deleted.
Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with sponsored ads and content: You authorize Facebook to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions on Facebook in relating to or in connection with advertisements, offers and other sponsored content that Facebook displays within its Products, without any compensation to you.

Ads of this kind can only be viewed by individuals who have the user's authorization to view their actions on Facebook.
You can find out more about your ad settings and preferences.
Permission to Update Software You Use or Download: If you download or use Facebook software, you grant Facebook permission to download and install updates to the software, where available.

Further provisions

Facebook will only make changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete and only in cases where such changes are reasonable for you and take due account of your interests.
Facebook will notify the user (e.g.
by email or through the Products) at least 30 days before making changes to these Conditions and will give the user the opportunity to consult them before their entry into force, unless the changes are required by law.
Once the updated Terms come into effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use the Products.
Facebook hopes that its Products will continue to be used.
However, if you do not agree to the updated Terms and want to leave the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.
Suspension or termination of your account
Facebook's goal is to make its users feel welcome and free to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If you post or share music, you must comply with Facebook's Music Guidelines.
If there is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms, the additional terms will apply to the extent of the conflict.

The user can appoint a person (defined as heir contact) to manage his memorialized account.

These Terms do not confer any rights on third party beneficiaries.
All of Facebook's rights and obligations in these Terms may be freely assigned by Facebook in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or other transaction.

if a person claims it and the username does not seem related to the name used in everyday life).
In such cases, Facebook will inform you in advance and explain the reasons behind the operation.
Facebook always appreciates user feedback and suggestions regarding its products and services.
