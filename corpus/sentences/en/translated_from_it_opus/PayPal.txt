Link and unlink a payment method
The money in your account is legally defined as "electronic money" and is recognized in the European Economic Area as a form of money that can be used for online transactions.
You may use a Payment Method to pay PayPal and get e-money into your account or to receive transfers from your account, as further described in these Terms of Use (see in particular Top up your account or transfer money and Fund your payment ).
You may link or unlink a credit, debit or prepaid card (where available), a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) from your PayPal account as a payment method.
PayPal may limit the availability of payment methods as part of its risk management.
You should keep your payment method information up to date (for example, credit card number and expiration date).
If this data changes, PayPal may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without involving you.
If you do not want PayPal to update your card information, you can contact your card issuer to request it or to remove your payment method from your PayPal account.
If PayPal updates your payment method, we will retain any preference settings linked to that method.
You may choose to confirm your card or bank account to allow PayPal to verify that it is valid and that you are the actual owner.
PayPal allows you to confirm your information through the "link and confirm" process (for cards) or the "bank account confirmation" process (for bank accounts), as well as through other procedures that PayPal may communicate to you. user or publish if necessary.
Ongoing authorization for PayPal to charge your payment methods
By linking a Payment Method to your PayPal account, you authorize PayPal to automatically debit/credit your linked Payment Method on an ongoing basis (subject to these Terms of Use and the terms of any mandate, e.g.
direct bank debit, used by the service provider of the payment method in question to arrange and maintain this authorization) of the requested e-money value:
To cover the payment amount (plus any transaction fees payable to PayPal) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.
To top up your account when you use the "Top Up Account" feature in your account interface.
PayPal may use the payment method again if the previous attempt was unsuccessful.
If you cancel an ongoing authorization from your payment method, you must reimburse PayPal for any e-money amounts already disbursed by PayPal but not yet paid to the payment method in question.
You can revoke your authorization by unlinking your payment method from your PayPal account.
SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and the European banking industry, created to make transactions within the European Union more efficient.
Each time you link a bank account to your PayPal account or use a new bank account for the first time as a payment method, you grant PayPal a SEPA direct debit mandate.
If you use a SEPA direct debit mandate for ongoing authorization:
You can access your Mandate and its Mandate Reference Number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change your Mandate for future transactions.
PayPal will notify you of the SEPA direct debit payment amount and the days required for PayPal to credit the amount from your bank account together with the purchase confirmation.
If PayPal resubmits a payment request via SEPA direct debit due to a reversal of the initial payment, no (additional) information on the amount and new expected times will be given.
You can request a refund from your bank at any time and up to eight weeks after the date of payment by SEPA direct debit, in accordance with your bank's conditions.
Risk of chargebacks on the payment method used and eCheck use cases
When you use a payment method, PayPal may keep the corresponding electronic money in a reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is a risk of chargeback by the payment method provider.
This situation occurs because PayPal does not have all the information needed to credit the payment money to your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of a chargeback.
When you ask PayPal to make a payment from your account to another user's account by funding it from your bank account, and PayPal stores the electronic money resulting from the transaction in the manner just described, the type of payment from your bank account is called "eCheck".
See the Funding Payments Sent from Your Account section below to learn how PayPal uses eChecks.
Have and use a PayPal Balance
You will not receive interest or other fees on the money in your account, as this money is electronic and European law prohibits paying interest on electronic money.
Furthermore, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, therefore the deposit guarantee in Luxembourg or the investor compensation schemes operated by the Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs cannot protect you.
PayPal may hold and transfer money to your account in and between:
Your PayPal Balance e
The reserve account
at any time, pursuant to these Terms of Use.
Saldo PayPal
The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or transfers.
When you use the PayPal payment service to pay another user, PayPal agrees to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient's account.
At the time of checkout, you must have a sufficient PayPal balance to cover the amount of the payment made and the fees due for the transaction.
Other requirements also apply: see Making Payments section below.
If you do not have a sufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred payment method, you may also request that PayPal obtain funds on your behalf from the applicable payment method and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance in order to process the payment.
When transferring money, you must have a sufficient PayPal balance to cover the amount you wish to transfer.
See Top up your account or transfer money to learn how to get a PayPal balance and how to transfer it.
If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount owed to PayPal at that time.
Reserve account
Money marked on the main account page as "pending", "unexecuted", "blocked" or otherwise restricted at any given time is held in the account area which serves as a reserve account.
You may not access or use the money in your reserve account.
Top up your account or transfer money
Top up your account
To have electronic money in your account, you may, under these Terms of Use:
Accept payments into your account from other people.
In this case, PayPal may charge fees.
Obtain electronic money by paying an equivalent amount to PayPal.
You can get e-money from PayPal:
Automatically, using your applicable payment methods to cover the payment amounts you ask PayPal to send to other users (and the transaction fees you pay PayPal).
Manually, using the "Recharge Account" function available in the account interface to pay PayPal an amount in electronic money or to ask PayPal to debit it from the payment method connected to the account.
Making any payment to PayPal by your payment method provider is your payment method provider's legal responsibility.
PayPal has no control over how long it takes to complete your payment.
Transfer money
If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw an amount and transfer it to the payment method linked to your PayPal account, subject to approval from PayPal from time to time.
The linked payment method to which you can transfer the amount can be a bank account or a credit or debit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.
When you ask PayPal to transfer an amount from your balance under these Terms of Use, PayPal may:
Convert e-money into cash to transfer to your designated payment method.
Instruct your bank to transfer such money to your designated payment method.
PayPal undertakes to send the transfer payment instructions to your bank by the end of the next business day ('business day' means a day on which Luxembourg banks are open to the public) if no other delays occur under the these Terms of Use.
Once your bank receives these instructions, PayPal will have no control over how long it takes to complete your payment.
At this point, PayPal's bank, your payment method provider, and the payment processors they rely on will be responsible for transferring the money to your designated payment method, and this may affect how long it takes to complete your payment. actual crediting of the money.
PayPal may allow you to transfer money by sending it to
An eligible bank account (where PayPal allows) via:
A standard transfer to the bank account linked to your account (this transfer/redeem functionality is sometimes called a âbank account transferâ).
A direct debit from the bank account linked to your account.
PayPal may allow the above transfers to be made via the debit card linked to the relevant bank account.
Your Mastercard or Visa credit card (if available).
Fees apply to transfers.
Additionally, PayPal will communicate fees in advance each time you initiate a transfer.
The payment method (for example, bank account or card) to which you request the transfer must be denominated in the original currency in which the account was opened or in another currency supported by PayPal for transfers in the country of residence of the user. 'user.
You can only transfer your PayPal balance in the currency you open your account, unless otherwise agreed.
In order to transfer an amount from a PayPal balance into another currency, you will need to convert that balance to the currency in which your account is opened or the conversion will occur automatically at the time of transfer.
PayPal will use its own transaction exchange rate.
This means that if the user transfers money:
to a PayPal balance in a currency other than the original account opening currency, conversion to that currency will be done using PayPal's transaction exchange rate;
to a payment method (for example, a bank account or card) that has a different currency than the original currency in which the account was opened, the conversion to the currency of the payment method will be made using the PayPal transaction exchange rate.
Your card issuer may also charge you if a currency conversion is required to the currency in which your card was issued.
If the user has a Business account, this exchange rate does not apply.
Instead, you will be charged a currency conversion fee applied to an external exchange rate, as described on the fees page (see also âHow PayPal Converts Currenciesâ).
To protect you, other PayPal users, and PayPal itself from loss, as well as to help us comply with anti-money laundering regulations and other legal obligations, PayPal may delay a transfer in certain situations, including where it is necessary verify that you have authorized the transfer or where payments to your PayPal account are subject to reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal, or buyer dispute).
If a restriction is placed on your PayPal account or a payment is blocked, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a transfer from your PayPal account is pending, the The user will need to transfer again after the restriction or block has been removed or the negative balance has been fully repaid.
PayPal may set limits on transfers, and you may be able to view them by logging into your PayPal account.
To remove the transfer limit, you must follow the procedure that PayPal will communicate or publish to you from time to time (the notification may be located on the main account page).
Manage money in different currencies
Upon opening, the account is configured to be used with its opening currency.
The user's account opening currency is the euro (EUR).
The user can set the currency on their card.
PayPal can configure the account to allow the user to also use it to deposit money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the one in which the account was opened.
PayPal may allow an account holder to convert their balance into another currency.
If your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount of a payment you order in a specific currency, PayPal may perform a currency conversion from a PayPal balance into another currency to cover the shortfall.
Sending payments in certain currencies may be restricted in some countries.
PayPal may also allow you to choose how payments received into your account in currencies other than the original opening currency are handled and/or converted.
To receive money in a currency other than the currency you opened your account, you may need to create a balance in that currency or convert the money to another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.
Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatically converting your money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.
If you receive a payment from someone who does not have a PayPal account and that payment is made in a currency that your current account setup does not allow you to use, PayPal may automatically convert the amount received into a currency supported by your account at the time of payment.
For information on how to transfer in different currencies, see the Transferring money section above.
If any of your account currency balances have, for any reason, an amount owed to PayPal, PayPal may choose to offset that amount by using money in your other currency balance or by deducting it from amounts received on your account. your account or the amounts you attempt to transfer or send from your account or another account, as well as by deducting the amount from any transfer you attempt to make.
If for a period of 21 days your PayPal balance reflects an amount owed to PayPal that is not expressed in euros (EUR), PayPal may convert the amount owed into euros (EUR).
At its discretion, PayPal may impose limits on the amount of money you may convert or the number of conversions you may perform.
You are responsible for all risks associated with having multiple currencies in one PayPal account.
You may not operate or convert currencies for speculative purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of earning money by exploiting currency conversion rates.
PayPal may block, cancel or reverse any transaction that violates these rules.
PayPal Currency Conversion Mode
Except as provided below and on the fees page, in the event of a currency conversion by PayPal, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate established by PayPal for the applicable conversion.
The transaction exchange rate is adjusted periodically, typically between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) (in New York City, United States) on each business day.
Such changes are effective immediately.
You can access the "Currency Converter" tool to find out the transaction exchange rate applicable to certain currency conversions.
The exchange rates displayed by the "Currency Converter" indicate the rates applicable at the time the tool is used and may vary.
Subject to the other provisions of the Terms of Use, when you complete a transaction, you will be shown the exchange rate of the transaction so that you can decide whether to pay at the indicated rate.
Under certain circumstances, the transaction exchange rate may be applied to the payment for the transaction regardless of when the payment is processed or only if the seller has processed the transaction within a certain period, as indicated before the transaction.
After this period, PayPal may use the exchange rate in effect at the time the seller processes the transaction or may refuse to perform the currency conversion.
If you have authorized a payment under an automatic debit agreement, or if PayPal is unable to communicate with you when you authorize a payment in person (for example, due to lack of connectivity by you or the seller at that time) and currency conversion is used for such payment, PayPal will use the exchange rate in effect at the time the seller processes the transaction.
The transaction exchange rate for payments under the automatic debit agreement or in the event that PayPal was unable to communicate with the customer at the time the customer authorized an in-person payment, may therefore vary from time to time.
If you are a seller and have agreed to pay the exchange rate of the transaction for the buyer, or if you have a Business account and perform a currency conversion on your PayPal account that is not part of a specific transaction to be or account (for example, by converting your balance into another currency), the transaction exchange rate does not apply.
Instead, you will pay a currency conversion fee applied to an external exchange rate, as described on the fees page.
The external exchange rate depends on the rates established by global markets on the day of conversion or the previous business day.
Currency conversion options
When your payment is from a credit or debit card and PayPal determines that a currency conversion is necessary, you agree and authorize PayPal to convert the currency for your credit or debit card company.
If provided for by the card issuing company and its network, the user can have the issuing company convert the currency of the card payment into the currency of the PayPal account used by the user to send the payment.
This choice can be presented to the user in various ways, including configuring the card currency, the possibility of choosing which currency to carry out the transaction in, who to have the conversion performed (PayPal or the card issuing company) or which conversion rate is applied to the transaction.
If the card issuing company converts the currency, the card issuing company will establish the currency conversion rate and any fees to be charged.
PayPal will always convert for transactions where you use your existing balance or linked bank account as your payment method.
If PayPal determines that a currency conversion is required to process a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not have the ability to decide who, PayPal or your card issuer, will perform the currency conversion for you. the payment made with the reserve payment method.
If the currency conversion is offered at a point of sale by the seller and not by PayPal, and the user decides to authorize the payment transaction based on the fees and exchange rate charged by the seller, PayPal assumes no responsibility for such conversion currency.
Account statements and requests for accounting documents
Unless restricted, you may log in to your PayPal account to view and download your statement.
Rather than receiving periodic statements via email, you agree to review your transactions by reviewing your PayPal account history.
The main payment details will be sent to the user via email and the transaction history will also be updated and made available to the user who can consult it at any time by logging into their account.
The user can also access a downloadable report from their PayPal account.
The report shows all fees and any other amounts charged to the user's PayPal account during the specified period.
The report will be updated and made available only if fees have been applied or operations have been performed on the user's PayPal account in the specified period.
The method by which PayPal provides transaction information will allow you to keep and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.
PayPal reserves the right to charge a fee if we provide you with additional information or transaction history and other fee information by an alternative method, but we will not charge you for data requested pursuant to a good faith representation of an error on your PayPal account.
Rates
The rates applied by PayPal on its services are indicated on the rates page.
The fees shown include all applicable taxes, but there may be other taxes or charges that are not paid through or imposed by PayPal.
You are responsible for telephone and Internet service costs required by your provider and other similar or associated services resulting from your use of PayPal services.
PayPal may deduct its fees from your PayPal balance.
PayPal may deduct its transaction fees directly from the amounts it transfers before crediting the money to your PayPal balance.
All information on the amounts credited and fees charged will be communicated to the user via email or included in the transaction history (which the user can consult by logging into the account).
If a payment requires a fee to be paid to PayPal, you will be notified when you provide payment instructions to PayPal.
You may not discount or deduct amounts from PayPal's fees.
PayPal may charge you for any other services we provide to you outside of these Terms of Use.
Charges will be communicated to you at the time you request such services.
If you are a merchant and would like to claim (and maintain) the tiered merchant rate based on volume, the applicable merchant rate terms are listed below in the Receiving Payments section.
Make a payment
General provisions for making a payment
User payment instruction
PayPal may allow the user to send a payment instruction using the different methods that will be communicated to him from time to time.
The way in which the user can send a payment instruction may depend on the type of payment to be made, for example:
To pay for a purchase or make a donation, many sellers and/or fundraising entities or individuals allow users to instruct PayPal to pay via a dedicated PayPal Checkout or by integrating another PayPal payment collection method into their sites.
To send a payment to someone, you can log in to your PayPal account and use the "Send Money" feature.
PayPal may require you to authenticate your payment instruction (i.e. provide the data necessary to ensure that you personally give the instruction, for example by submitting your correct login details including your email address and password) and to otherwise access your PayPal account to provide PayPal with the payment instruction.
To speed up the payment process, PayPal offers the user the possibility to select some recipients to make them "trusted beneficiaries" of pre-authorized payments.
To make these types of payments, the user generally does not need to access their PayPal account (with password, PIN or otherwise).
The user can of course access the list of trusted beneficiaries in their PayPal account and modify it at any time.
Canceling a payment instruction
Once sent to PayPal, a payment instruction can no longer be canceled unless it is subject to an automatic debit agreement (see further details below).
How long does a payment take?
Payments between PayPal users depart from the payer's account no later than the business day following the date of receipt of the complete payment instruction.
Payment will be made from your account within 2 business days following the date of receipt of complete payment instructions if this occurs:
On a non-working day.
After 4pm on a working day.
PayPal may allow you to request payment on a specified future date and, if so, the money will be transferred from your account on the specified date.
The times indicated above may be extended following the application of other clauses of these Conditions of Use.
Cases in which PayPal may refuse to process a payment
PayPal may consider the payment instruction incomplete and refuse to process the payment if:
The user's PayPal balance does not cover the payment amount.
PayPal has reason to believe that the linked payment methods do not have sufficient funds to cover the payment amount.
You have not provided all mandatory data requested during the checkout processes that PayPal uses to process your payment instructions (for example, sufficient recipient information that PayPal may request and authentication of your payment instruction ).
The payment exceeds the sending limit communicated by PayPal to the user when the user attempts to make the payment.
PayPal has reason to believe that unauthorized activity has occurred on your account, or that you have violated these Terms of Use.
Cases in which the payment is not accepted by the recipient
A PayPal user can send a payment to a recipient who doesn't have a PayPal account, but that recipient must open a PayPal account to collect the money.
The recipient who already has a PayPal account can refuse to accept the money.
If the recipient refuses to accept the money or does not open a PayPal account and does not request the money within 30 days from the date of sending, the money (including any fees charged) will be credited back to your account.
See Account Refunds to learn what can happen when you receive a refund to your PayPal account.
Sending Limits
At its discretion, PayPal may impose limits on the amount and value of payments you may make, including those for your purchases.
You can view any sending limits by logging into your PayPal account.
To remove the sending limit, the user must follow the procedure communicated to him by PayPal or published from time to time (and possibly reported on the main page of the user's account).
Set up automatic debits to your account
Late seller payments
When you pay for certain sellers or certain purchases (for example, purchases that need to be shipped to you or can be updated and finalized by the seller):
Authorize the seller to collect payment later.
Instructs PayPal to automatically pay the seller when they request it.
Your permission typically remains valid for 30 days, but may last longer.
If you have a positive balance, PayPal may hold the payment amount on that balance until the seller collects it.
If your payment requires currency conversion by PayPal, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time your payment is processed.
Your authorization allows the seller to update the amount of your payment before collecting it (to reflect any changes made to your purchase that are agreed upon between the seller and you, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges, or discounts).
PayPal is never asked to verify any changes (not even when the payment is made).
PayPal may transfer any amount subject to your authorization and receipt of instructions from the seller regarding the final payment amount.
Automatic debit payments
You can use automatic debit to manage recurring payments to the same recipient.
When you enter into an automatic debit agreement:
to. You authorize designated recipients to collect payments from your account on dates determined by them (payments may relate to amounts due for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract between you and the recipient).
b. You instruct and authorize PayPal to pay designated recipients (or other recipients designated by the designated recipient) when such recipients request PayPal to make the payment.
The recipient will thus become a "trusted beneficiary" of all the payments that the user makes in his favor and for this reason the user will not always be forced to access the PayPal account (with password, PIN or other) to approve recurring payments to expected deadlines.
Payments made under the Auto Debit Agreement may be in varying amounts and may be sent on various dates.
PayPal is only a payment service provider, so it cannot know what the user has established in his agreements with the recipient or why the latter has decided to collect the payment, nor should he expect otherwise.
PayPal has no obligation to verify or confirm the amount requested by the recipient for the purposes of processing payments made under the automatic debit agreement.
PayPal uses different names for payments that may be covered by an automatic debit agreement, including âautomatic payments,â âsubscription payments,â ârecurring payments,â âreferral transactions,â âpreauthorized transfers,â or âpreauthorized payments.â ".
You may cancel an auto-debit agreement at any time via your account interface or by contacting PayPal.
If a payment under the automatic debit agreement is due before the end of the business day following the day of the cancellation request, PayPal may decide to cancel the agreement only after such payment has been made.
When you cancel an automatic debit agreement, you may still owe the recipient for goods or services received but not yet paid for.
If PayPal determines that an automatic charge requires a currency conversion and performs it, it will apply the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment is processed.
The exchange rate may vary for each payment transaction.
Account refunds
How refunds are made
PayPal may allow the recipient of your payment to:
Refuse to accept it.
Decide to accept it and then use the PayPal service to send the user a refund of the entire amount or part of it at a later time.
PayPal will credit the amount of rejected or refunded payments to your balance.
PayPal will credit the amount of uncollected payments to your balance within 30 days of the payment being made.
If the amount of a payment is returned to you in one of the ways above, PayPal may convert the returned amount into one of the following currencies:
In the currency of the balance used for the initial payment (before any conversion was made to the currency received by the recipient).
In the original currency in which the user's account was opened.
In US dollars (if you do not already have a US dollar balance, PayPal will open one for you).
If the initial payment you sent required a currency conversion, PayPal will reconvert the returned amount from the currency in which it was received by the recipient as follows:
If the amount is returned within one day of the initial payment date, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the initial payment date, so that you receive the original amount in the original currency converted for the initial payment.
If the amount is refunded after one day from the date of the initial payment, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of conversion of the refunded amount and you will provide your consent.
The exchange rate of the transaction can be applied immediately and without notifying the user.
PayPal may also automatically take the returned amount from your balance and transfer it to the payment method you used for the initial payment.
Transfers may also include a currency conversion (see Transferring Money section above).
Risks when receiving refunds
The amount returned may be less than the initial payment amount.
This can happen for the following reasons:
The recipient sends a refund worth less than the initial payment amount.
As PayPal is solely a payment service provider, it has no way of knowing how much of a refund you are entitled to from the recipient of your initial payment or why they refunded a certain amount.
Transaction exchange rate fluctuations.
PayPal is not responsible for any losses resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except when the refund sent by the recipient is a payment incorrectly processed by PayPal.
PayPal is not responsible for the difference between the value of the initial payment and the value of the corresponding refund, except when the refund is an incorrect payment (see the Troubleshooting section).
Finance the payment
Select a preferred payment method
You can select a preferred payment method after logging into your account.
Under these Terms of Use, your preferred payment method will be used as the default method for payments sent from your account.
For some automatic debit agreements, you can set different preferred payment methods.
Special payment solutions
Some payments may be made through special payment solutions linked to your PayPal account, such as seller-specific or transaction-specific balances, gift cards, or other promotional payment solutions.
The use and priority of these special payment solutions are subject to additional terms of use between you and PayPal.
The user's main account page may display the theoretical amount available in special payment solutions to make eligible payments at a particular time.
This amount does not constitute electronic money, is not considered part of your PayPal balance, and is not redeemable for cash.
It represents only the amount of electronic money that PayPal is willing to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and solely for the purpose of immediately funding) an eligible payment, pursuant to the additional terms of use of such solution of special payment and only for the period indicated in the same.

PayPal will obtain electronic money for the payment sent from your account from the following funding sources, in the order listed here and to the extent available:
Special payment solutions (if available for the transaction in question)

PayPal Purchase Protection does not constitute a guarantee of either the product or the service.
No guarantees of any kind are given.
PayPal Purchase Protection is an additional service and does not replace the legal guarantees provided by current consumer protection legislation.
Regardless of the application of Purchase Protection, consumers have the right to assert their rights under the legal guarantee of conformity of the goods supplied by the seller.
PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your complaint meets the requirements of the PayPal Buyer Protection program.
PayPal's initial decision is final, but you may have an appeal against PayPal if you have new or substantiated data that was not available at the time the initial decision was made, or if you believe an error occurred in the decision-making process.
The program terms are set out on the PayPal Purchase Protection program page and form an integral part of these Terms of Use.

General provisions for receiving payments
PayPal may allow anyone (whether an account holder or not) to submit a payment instruction that results in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.

If in your point of sale, the user (and not PayPal) offers the buyer currency conversion for an amount received via PayPal, the user is required to communicate to the buyer the exchange rate applied and any commissions that will be applied to the payment transaction.
PayPal assumes no responsibility towards the buyer in the event that the user does not inform him about the exchange rate and related fees.
You acknowledge that failure to disclose the exchange rate and related fees charged to the buyer may constitute a criminal offence.
Any payment sent to you may be subject to reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or block, as permitted by these Terms of Use.
Reception limits
At its discretion, PayPal may impose limits on the amount and value of payments you may receive, including money from purchases.
To remove the receiving limit, the user is required to follow the procedure that PayPal will communicate to him or on occasion will publish (sometimes on the main page of the user's account).

The user undertakes not to apply surcharges for the use of PayPal services.

In the event of a buyer complaint relating to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide PayPal with additional proof of delivery or other documents and information relating to the transaction.
Marketplace sellers
If you are a seller on a marketplace or sell through a third-party application where PayPal is available, you must comply with all applicable purchase protection program rules of the marketplace or third-party selling application carried out via that channel.
These safeguards may require you to take certain actions and may affect how complaints are processed.
PayPal may allow you to authorize certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts owed by you to the marketplace or to the buyer (as applicable) following a complaint, subject to the marketplace's resolution procedure, which in PayPal are defined as "Amounts due to the marketplace".
By providing such authorization, when the marketplace notifies PayPal of the complaint, you authorize PayPal to send payments of all amounts owed to the marketplace related to such complaint by transferring them from your PayPal account to the marketplace or to the affected buyer (at as appropriate), in accordance with the instructions that the marketplace will have provided to PayPal.

All complaints submitted directly to the marketplace are governed exclusively by the marketplace's rules.
PayPal Seller Protection does not include or regulate complaints against the seller made directly to the marketplace by its buyers.

When you have access to account statements or other account activity information made available by PayPal in connection with your Business account, you will have sixty (60) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies regarding fees or other costs charged by PayPal.
If you fail to notify PayPal within this period, it is understood that you believe this information to be correct and PayPal will therefore have no obligation to rectify it.
For purposes of this provision, such errors or discrepancies with respect to fees or costs are different from unauthorized transactions or other errors in electronic transfer, for which different notification times are established as specified herein.
Refunds and payment reversals
When you receive a payment, it may be refunded or reversed.
PayPal may allow you to send the buyer a refund of the payment.
PayPal may reverse your payment under certain circumstances.
For more details see the rest of this section.
Refunds

Of your legal and contractual obligations to the buyer for any amount returned by you.
Any difference between the cost of the initial payment incurred by the buyer and the value of the amount returned to the buyer (due, for example, to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the transaction), unless the refund is due to an incorrect payment (see the Troubleshooting section).
See the PayPal Fees section for more details on the fees you paid to PayPal as the recipient of the initial payment and that PayPal retains when you take advantage of the special merchant transaction refund feature available in your PayPal account, according to as permitted by PayPal from time to time, unless the refund is due to an incorrect payment (see the Troubleshooting section).
Cancellations
If you receive a payment into your account, you will have to reimburse PayPal for the full amount of the payment and any losses resulting from processing the payment (including any chargeback fees or dispute fees).
This type of transaction may involve PayPal's liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) to third parties (including the paying party and its payment method provider).
A chargeback occurs when PayPal exercises its right to offset amounts from your account pursuant to the Reimbursement for Your Liability section of these Terms of Use.
If your PayPal balance for a particular currency is not sufficient to cover the amount owed to PayPal in that currency, PayPal may convert from a balance in another currency to offset the amount at its currency exchange rate. transaction applicable at the time the chargeback is processed.
This means, for example, that if you are a seller, the payment amounts you have received into your account may be removed from your account once the goods or services sold have been delivered or performed.
A chargeback can occur when PayPal:
Reimburse a buyer covered by PayPal Buyer Protection following a complaint they raise against you.
Compensate the buyer or their payment method provider (or both) because either has filed a claim regarding the payment amount that is subject to the payment method provider's chargeback procedure.
For example:
If the buyer used a card to finance the payment to you, they may try to get a "chargeback" from the card company.
The card company, not PayPal, determines whether the paying party is eligible for a chargeback.
To learn more about chargebacks, please see the Chargeback Guide accessible via the PayPal Security page and the section titled âSafe Selling.â
The PayPal Security page is accessible from the PayPal website.
PayPal charges a fee for receiving a chargeback request.
If the buyer used a bank account to fund the payment, he or the bank may proceed to execute a bank chargeback.
The requested amount may be higher than the initial amount received by you due to currency exchange rate fluctuations from the time of payment to the time of request.
PayPal may be forced to compensate the buyer if the buyer claims that there has been a problem with the payment (including cases where the payment was not authorized or was incorrect or where an unexpected payment was made under a payment contract). automatic debit).
In this regard, please refer to the Troubleshooting section.
PayPal may issue a chargeback for any other reason under these Terms of Use, including the Actions PayPal May Take If You Engage in Prohibited Activities provision.
Dispute fees
PayPal will charge sellers a dispute fee to facilitate the online process of resolving disputes relating to transactions processed through a buyer's PayPal account or through the "Payment Without PayPal Account" service.
The dispute fee applies when the buyer files a complaint directly with PayPal or requests a chargeback from their card company or a chargeback from their bank.
The dispute fee will be charged as a standard dispute fee or a high-volume dispute fee.
The dispute fee will be charged in the currency selected by the user from the list of those available for the original transaction.
If the transaction was made in a currency not listed in the dispute fee table, the fee will be charged in the currency of your primary account.
The dispute fee will be deducted from your PayPal account after the complaint is resolved.
The amount of the dispute fee will be determined at the time the dispute case is created.
The rate depends on the ratio of all Item Not Received and Noticeably Not As Described complaints that the user received to the total amount of sales recorded by the user in the last quarter (dispute ratio).
Total claims include all Item Not Received and Noticeably Not As Described claims that are submitted to PayPal directly or through the buyers' card issuers or banks.
Total complaints do not include "Unauthorized Transaction" complaints.
For example, for a complaint opened in September, the dispute ratio is calculated by considering the ratio between the total complaints received and the total sales that occurred in the months of June, July and August.
September's claim percentage will determine the dispute fee applicable to all claims filed in October.
If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you have made more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three months, the high-volume dispute fee will apply to each dispute.
Otherwise, disputes will be subject to the standard dispute fee.
Disputes that:
These are requests forwarded to the PayPal Resolution Center and not converted into a complaint with PayPal.
They are resolved directly between you and the buyer and are not converted into a complaint with PayPal.
They were submitted directly by the buyer to PayPal as unauthorized transactions.
at PayPal's sole discretion, meet all PayPal Seller Protection program requirements.
are claims related to a transaction with a value less than double the amount of the standard dispute fee.
They have been resolved in your favor by PayPal or your issuer.
Disputes that:
These are requests forwarded to the PayPal Resolution Center and not converted into a complaint with PayPal.
They are resolved directly between you and the buyer and are not converted into a complaint with PayPal.
were submitted directly by the buyer to PayPal as unauthorized transactions.
Sellers who are charged high-volume dispute fees may be required to provide information to PayPal including the reason for the increase in their dispute rate.
Even if neither the standard dispute rate nor the high-volume dispute rate applies to the disputes listed above, the complaint can still be included in the overall dispute ratio calculation.
Chargeback fees
For transactions that are not processed through a buyer's PayPal account or through the "PayPal Without Account Payment" service, where the buyer attempts to obtain a chargeback for the transaction with the card company, PayPal will charge the user the chargeback fees to facilitate the chargeback process.
These charges will apply regardless of whether the buyer attempts to obtain a chargeback against the card company.
Applicable chargeback fees will be deducted from your PayPal account.
Chargeback fees are applied as specified in the chargeback fee table and are charged in the currency selected by the user from the list of currencies available for the original transaction.
If the transaction was made in a currency that is not in the chargeback fee table, the fee will be charged in the currency of your primary account.
Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on Sellers
You should read the PayPal Buyer Protection provisions and, if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you should also be aware of the PayPal Buyer Protection applicable to buyers in each affected country, as the rights of buyers targeted by individual programs can have effects on sellers.
For more information about PayPal Buyer Protection, go to the Legal Agreements page, select the buyer's country at the top of the page, and read the PayPal Buyer Protection program provisions found in the corresponding Terms of Use.
If you are denied a PayPal Buyer Protection claim in any country:
You will be required to forfeit the entire purchase price of the item or transaction plus original shipping costs.
This condition applies when you are the primary seller or a secondary seller of goods or services.
For example, agents selling event tickets or online travel agents will lose the entire purchase amount paid by the buyer.
In some cases, the item may not be returned to you.
The complaint under Purchase Protection is considered fully resolved only if:
the refund to the buyer is processed via PayPal, or
you provide PayPal with evidence acceptable to PayPal, in its sole discretion, that the buyer has accepted the alternative resolution offered.
You will not be entitled to any refund of PayPal fees paid in connection with the sale.
If your complaint involved receiving an item that was significantly not as described, typically the item may not be returned to you, or you may be required to accept the return of the item and pay return shipping costs.
If your complaint was for an item received that was significantly out of specification and sold by you and found to be counterfeit, you will be required to refund the full purchase price to the buyer and the item may not be returned to you.
If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services sold through eBay, you are responsible for reading and understanding eBay's Money Back Guarantee program.
Unless you have opted out of the program by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as the basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.
If your Cash account or PayPal Business account balance is insufficient to cover the amount, PayPal may:
Proceed to block the PayPal account until it contains sufficient money to cover the amount.
Create a negative balance on the user's PayPal account.

Blocks, limitations and reservations
What are blocks, limitations and reservations?
In certain circumstances, to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers who use PayPal services, PayPal may take action at the account or transaction level.
If PayPal decides to take any of the actions described herein, we will generally notify you of the action we are taking, although we may, if it is reasonable (for example, if you violate these Terms of Use or when it is advisable for safety reasons), act without giving any notice to the user.
To request information regarding an account restriction, hold, or hold, please visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in the restriction, hold, or hold notification email.
You acknowledge and agree that any amounts blocked under these Terms of Use may be placed in your reserve account and that you will provide PayPal with all information that we may reasonably request from PayPal to enable us to determine whether the risk no longer exists .
Blocks
A hold is an action that PayPal can take under certain circumstances, either at the transaction or account level.
When PayPal freezes the amount of a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.
PayPal looks at many factors before blocking a payment, including: account reputation, transaction history, company type, past disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.
Some common situations that cause PayPal to block payments are those where it has reason to believe that:
The transactions are high risk, i.e. when the transaction involves the sale of goods or services that fall into a high risk category or when other facts known to PayPal may increase the number of chargeback requests, other complaints or disputes or when the sale concerns goods and services often involved in cases of fraud or illegal activities.
There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holder's sales activity, resulting in an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals or complaints received on their PayPal account.
A PayPal account is used in connection with prohibited activities.
A PayPal account involved in the transaction has been compromised, or stolen financial information (bank account or credit card) is being used to make payments, or a transaction has not been properly authorized.
A user attempts to send or transfer money received fraudulently.
A user has not provided sufficient information to allow PayPal to verify their identity or that of their business and/or the user's transaction history with PayPal is limited.
A payment sent to you as a seller is disputed as a payment to be canceled and reversed.
A buyer has filed a chargeback, refund, or complaint under PayPal Buyer Protection for a payment received from you.
The buyer files a complaint under the marketplace resolution procedure.
There is a risk that the money in your account will be transferred to your chosen payment method.
There is a risk of attribution of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of this risk can be found in the Actions PayPal May Take If You Engage in Prohibited Activities section above).
Payment review
When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, it reviews it carefully before approving it.
This procedure is implemented in cases where PayPal, in its reasonable discretion, has a reasonable suspicion that the buyer's account is being used for prohibited activities or for other reasons.
This includes cases where there is a risk of attribution of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of this risk can be found in the Actions PayPal May Take If You Engage in Prohibited Activities section above).
If a payment is subject to review, PayPal may:
Execute the payment order sent by the buyer.
Limit, at its discretion, the paying party's account immediately after the order is executed.
Proceed to block the payment.
Notify the recipient to delay delivery of the item purchased through payment.
This may delay the receipt of an item purchased by you as a buyer.
If PayPal authorizes the transaction, PayPal will notify the seller of this decision and invite them to ship the item.
If PayPal does not authorize the transaction, it will be canceled and your money will be returned to you, unless PayPal has a legal obligation to take other action.
All payments that pass the review stage are still subject to reversal as provided in these Terms of Use, but may be eligible for the PayPal Seller Protection program if they meet the requirements.
PayPal will notify you via email and/or in the "History" section of your PayPal account.
The object of the review of a payment is exclusively the payment itself.
The review is done to reduce the likelihood of PayPal users being involved in high-risk transactions.
Reviewing a payment is not an audit or representation by PayPal about the reputation, activities, or business characteristics of any party to the payment transaction and should not be considered disrespectful to any person.
Blocks due to user instructions
Certain features of PayPal may allow you (either directly or through someone authorized to act on your behalf, such as an online marketplace platform on which you transact sales) to authorize PayPal to freeze your money (including proceeds from payments received using PayPal) into your reserve account.
In this case, PayPal will show the user the status of the availability of the money blocked in his balance; the status description may vary depending on the feature the user uses to instruct PayPal to block.
PayPal will release the amount based on instructions received from you (or from the entity that you have authorized to act on your behalf), as provided in the remainder of these Terms of Use.
Account Limitations
The restrictions are in place to protect PayPal, buyers, and sellers when PayPal detects unauthorized activity, increased financial risk, or seemingly unusual or suspicious activity.
Restrictions also help PayPal collect data necessary to keep your PayPal account open.
There are several reasons why restrictions may apply to a user's PayPal account, including where PayPal has reason to believe that:
Someone may be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, in which case the restriction is necessary for security reasons and to investigate suspected fraudulent activity.
Someone has used your card or bank account without your authorization, for example, if your bank or credit or debit card company has reported this to PayPal.
You have violated these Terms of Use or the Acceptable Use Policy.
Your performance as a seller indicates that your PayPal account is at high risk.
Some examples: signs of poor sales performance resulting from unusually high numbers of complaints and chargebacks; selling a completely new or very expensive type of product; rapid increase in the usual sales volume.
There is a risk of attribution of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of this risk can be found in the Actions PayPal May Take If You Engage in Prohibited Activities section above).
PayPal may also limit your PayPal account to comply with applicable laws.
Before a restriction can be removed, you must resolve any issues with your account.
Typically, the restriction is removed after the user provides the requested information.
However, if after receiving the requested information PayPal believes that a risk still exists, we may decide to take steps to protect ourselves, other users, third parties or you from chargebacks, fees, sanctions, penalties, risks legal and/or regulatory and any other attribution of responsibility.
Reserves
PayPal may place a hold on an account at any time if we believe there is a high level of risk associated with you, your account, your business model, or your transactions.
When you place a reserve on a PayPal account, the money in the account, in whole or in part, becomes unavailable for transfer, to avoid the risk of any transactions you make being reversed or canceled, as well as any other related risks to your account and your use of PayPal services.
The decisions PayPal makes about whether to apply a reservation depend on a number of factors, including information made available to PayPal from internal sources or third parties.
PayPal takes into account a number of non-exclusive factors and evaluates whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:
The user's years of activity.
If your industry is at high risk of chargebacks.
Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.
Your personal and/or business financial reputation.
Your delivery times.
If you have a higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, complaints or disputes.
There are two types of reserves that apply separately or simultaneously to PayPal accounts:
The "Renewable Reserve" provides that a percentage of the amount of each transaction received each day is blocked and then unblocked at a later time according to pre-established times.
For example, the reserve can be set at 10% and blocked for a period of 90 days: this means that 10% of the money received on the 1st day is blocked and then released on the 91st day, 10% of the money received on the 2nd day it is blocked until the 92nd day and so on.
The Renewable Reserve is the most common type of reserve.
The âMinimum Reserveâ is a specific minimum amount that you must keep available in your balance at all times.
The Minimum Reserve is retained as an advance amount deposited in a single solution (also called Advance Reserve) or is created dynamically, similarly to the Renewable Reserve, accumulating a percentage of the amount of each sale until the minimum quota is reached pre-established.
If PayPal places a reserve on a PayPal account, the money will be transferred to your reserve account and will be "pending".
The user will be notified accordingly.
You will also be notified if PayPal changes your reserve type based on a change in its risk assessment.
You will, at your own expense, take any further action reasonably required to establish a reserve or other form of security as PayPal deems reasonably appropriate.
This includes signing all necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by PayPal to complete any form of security.
TROUBLESHOOTING
You are strongly advised to check your account regularly and carefully.
If the user encounters a problemâ¦
If you have reason to believe there is a problem with your account or PayPal services, you should do the following:
1.
First identify the type of problem
Unexpected automatic debit payment
In this case you have entered into an automatic debit agreement and a payment has been sent from your account to another PayPal account under that agreement but:
The user had not previously agreed with the recipient the exact amount of the payment.
The payment amount was higher than you could reasonably expect to pay based on previous charges and other circumstances.
Wrong payment
In this case, a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account did not occur as specified at the time of request (e.g. wrong or late amount, wrong recipient), or the payment was received by you.
Security/fraud issue
Unauthorized payment
In this case, a payment was sent from your account without authorization from either you or a person designated to make payments on your behalf.
Other type of security/fraud issue
In this case another security or fraud problem has occurred such as:
Unauthorized access has been made to your account.
The user's password or PIN has been compromised.
A device you use to access PayPal services has been lost, stolen, or disabled.
Before contacting PayPal, promptly follow the instructions in the âWhat to Do If You Have a Security Concernâ section of the Important Payment and Service Information section.
Another type of problem
In this case, there is some other type of problem with your account or PayPal services that was not mentioned above.
For example, PayPal may have made a real calculation or mathematical error on your PayPal account during a top-up or money transfer to/from your account.
If a purchase paid for with PayPal is not as described or has not been received, PayPal's Purchase Protection Policies may override those described in this section.
Please review the PayPal Purchase Protection Policy section to understand how to resolve these specific issues.
2.
I will inform PayPal of the problem
Contact PayPal as soon as possible to report the problem (specifying the type of problem in question so that PayPal can intervene as promptly as possible).
You must provide as much information about the circumstances of the problem as PayPal reasonably requests and take any reasonable steps to assist with the investigation.
If you report the problem orally, PayPal may also require you to report it in writing within the next 10 business days.
PayPal may disclose to third parties information it deems relevant in such circumstances, in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
What will PayPal do to help you...
In accordance with the remainder of these Terms of Use, PayPal's intent is to investigate the issue and work with you to resolve the issue within 60 days.
Also, if the problem is:
An unexpected payment for an automatic debit, within 10 business days of your notification, PayPal:
It will refund the payment amount to the user.
He will explain why he cannot make the refund.
A payment mistakenly sent to another PayPal account, PayPal:
It will immediately try to trace the payment and inform the user of the search result without charging them any amount.
It will compensate the user as soon as possible (and in any case no later than the end of the working day following notification of the problem) by returning his account to the state it would have been in if the incorrect payment had been sent in the correct way specified by the sender.
This means that:
If the incorrect payment resulted in you having less money than you would have had if the payment had been made as ordered, PayPal will credit your account for the difference.
If the incorrect payment resulted in you having more money than you would have if the payment had been made as directed, PayPal may charge your account for the difference.
We will make a refund to your account for loss or damage directly, reasonably and foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.
An unauthorized payment to another PayPal account, PayPal will return the user's account to the state it would have been in if the payment error occurred as soon as possible (and in any case no later than the end of the business day following notification of the problem). payment had never occurred.
This procedure may also include a refund of the payment to the user.
In which cases PayPal cannot compensate the user...
As stated above, you are not entitled to any compensation from PayPal and will have to repay any compensation already obtained from PayPal (which PayPal may reverse from your account) if:
You do not provide PayPal with all reasonably requested information regarding the circumstances of the problem (including failure to provide the required written notification within 10 business days of your verbally reporting the problem).
You do not take all reasonable steps requested by PayPal to support the investigation.
PayPal can prove that you acted fraudulently.
PayPal can demonstrate that the problem occurred due to causes beyond its control (such as a fire, flood, or loss of Internet connection), even though reasonable precautions were taken.
PayPal has reason to believe that there is no issue that requires compensation to you.
At least one of the following specific cases has occurred:
Unexpected automatic debit payment
Wrong payment
Unauthorized payment
The user reports the problem to PayPal more than eight weeks after the payment was made.
You have authorized PayPal to make the payment and the payment details have been made known to you by PayPal or the seller at least four weeks before the payment is processed.
The user reports the problem to PayPal more than 13 months after the day of making the payment.
PayPal can demonstrate that you have provided incorrect payment details.
PayPal can prove that the payment was sent as and when specified and requested by the buyer.
For a reason beyond PayPal's control, the user did not have sufficient balance to complete the payment.
PayPal can demonstrate that its system was not functioning properly and that the user was aware of the outage when he or she made the transaction.
A delay that you believe is the cause of an incorrect payment is actually due to PayPal placing a hold, restriction or reservation under these Terms of Use.
The user reports the problem to PayPal more than 13 months after the day of making the payment.
PayPal can demonstrate that the payment was made because you intentionally or grossly negligently failed to maintain the security of your account (for example, you recklessly chose to share your PayPal ID, password or PIN with other people ).
There was another type of security/fraud issue that the user did not report to PayPal.
PayPal will not refund any unauthorized payments made from your account before you report the issue.
Sometimes the problem may be detected by PayPal first.
To notify you of a problem, PayPal uses the Message Center, which you can consult by logging into your account.
If it is necessary for the user to act promptly, PayPal can also use other communication channels, such as email, to solicit his intervention.
If a payment is made in error using your Payment Method, PayPal may correct the error by debiting or crediting the amount, as applicable, to your appropriate Payment Method.
