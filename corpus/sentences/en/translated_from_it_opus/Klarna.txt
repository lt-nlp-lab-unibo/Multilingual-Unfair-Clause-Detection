1.
AUTOMATIC FILLING AND PREFERENCES
In order to offer you a simple and frictionless shopping experience, we will store some information about you and use it to automatically fill in forms while you shop.
This will allow you to save time and focus on more important things than filling out the same information every time.
Here are some more details on how it works.
Autofill while you shop with Klarna
When you use Klarna for the first time, you will be asked to create a Klarna user account to make your future interactions with Klarna even easier.
We will store this information in our systems so that when you return to us or use one of our Services, you will only need to provide us with limited information.
We will treat all personal information we collect when creating your Klarna user account in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
In cases where we are able to identify you, we may automatically compile certain information about you, such as name, address, telephone number, email, date of birth and card details.
Autofill is based on information stored in your Klarna user account.
An example of when autofill is used is when you purchase directly from the Klarna App.
2.
KLARNA APP
The Klarna App, which you can access via mobile application or web portal, is your Online Shopping Assistant, providing your control center for all your Klarna purchases and all the other great features Klarna offers.
Through the Klarna App you can pay for your purchases, track your packages and much more.
Some of these features are activated by downloading the App or logging in via the web portal, while others can be activated by you after you log in.
Klarna wants to offer you the best shopping experience and the ability to search from a large number of stores on the Klarna App.
We may not have a business relationship with all stores displayed or searchable through the Klarna App.
In this case Klarna acts like a web browser or search engine, simply redirecting you to the store's website.
