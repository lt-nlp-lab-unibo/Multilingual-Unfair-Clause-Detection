Please read them carefully.
Our Services are very heterogeneous, so sometimes other additional terms or requirements relating to specific products (including age requirements) may apply.
The additional terms will be available with the related Services and will form part of the contract entered into with us by the user in case of use of these Services.

Some of our Services allow you to upload, transmit, store, send or receive content.
The user retains any intellectual property rights held on such content.
In short, what belongs to the user remains his property.

The rights you grant under this license are for the limited purpose of using, promoting and improving our Services and developing new ones.
This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, if you have a business listing added to Google Maps).
Some Services may offer ways of accessing and removing the content provided to that Service.
Additionally, some of our Services have terms or settings that restrict the scope of our use of content posted to those Services.
You must ensure that you have the necessary rights to grant us this license with respect to any content submitted to our Services.
Our automated systems analyze user content (including emails) in order to deliver personally relevant product features, such as personalized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.
This analysis occurs when the contents are transmitted, received and stored.
If the user has a Google account, the name and profile photo as well as the operations carried out on Google or through third-party applications connected to the Google account (such as +1, write reviews and post comments) can be viewed by Google on its Services, including display in ads and other commercial contexts.
We will respect the choices made by the user in order to limit the sharing or visibility settings within their Google account.
For example, the user can choose his settings so that his name and image are not displayed in an advertisement.

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, such software may automatically update on the user's device if a new version or feature is available.
In some Services, you may be able to change the automatic update settings.
Google grants the user a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided by Google within the Services.

Open source software is important to us.
Some software programs used in our Services may be offered with an open source license that we will make available to the user.
The open source license may include provisions that expressly override some of these terms.
Modification and interruption of the provision of the Services

The user can stop using our Services at any time, although we will be sorry to see him go away.
Google may also interrupt the provision of Services to the user or establish new access limits to the Services at any time.

For our Services we set a commercially responsible level of competence and attention and we hope that their use is pleasing to users.
However, we cannot make promises about some aspects of our Services.

However, any changes related to the new functions of a Service or any changes made for legal reasons will take effect immediately.
If the user does not accept the modified terms of a Service, he is invited to stop using it.
In the event of a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will prevail.
These terms govern the relationship between Google and the user, and do not give rise to any rights of third party beneficiaries.
If the user does not comply with these terms, the failure to promptly take measures on our part cannot be understood as a waiver of any rights we have (for example, the right to take action in the future).
