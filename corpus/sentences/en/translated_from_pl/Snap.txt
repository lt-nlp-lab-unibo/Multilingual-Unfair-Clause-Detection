Snap Group Limited Terms of Service
(for non-US users)
Effective Date: January 10, 2017
Welcome!
We are delighted that you intend to use Snapchat and our other products and services, all of which are collectively referred to as "Services".
We have drawn up these Terms of Service (referred to by us as the "Terms") in order to inform you about the rules governing the relationship between us.
While every effort has been made to keep the Terms and Conditions in plain language, some parts of the Terms have the wording typical of traditional contracts.
There is a good reason for that: these Terms do in fact constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Snap Group Limited.
Therefore, please read them carefully.
By using the Services, you consent to the Terms.
If you do not give your consent, you should not use the Services.
These Terms will apply to you if you live outside of the United States or use the Services on behalf of a non-US based legal entity.
If you live in the United States or use the services on behalf of a US-based legal entity, Snap Inc.'s Terms and Conditions apply.
ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU USE THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A LEGAL PERSON, THE LEGAL PERSON IS BINDED BY AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE HEREIN.

2.
Rights granted to you
Snap Group Limited grants you a personal, area-unlimited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license, free of charge and non-sublicensable, to access and use the Services.
The sole purpose of the license is to allow you to enjoy the benefits of the Service as permitted by these Terms and our usage guidelines, e.g.
Community guidelines.
Software provided to you may automatically download and install new versions, updates, and other features.
The user may be able to configure automatic download in the device settings.
You may not copy, modify, reproduce, sell, or lease any part of our Services, or reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of the software, unless such restriction is prohibited by law or you have obtained our written permission to do so.
3.
User Granted Rights
Many Services allow users to create, upload, post and store content.
If you use these features, you will retain all original ownership rights to the content, but grant us a license to use them.
The scope of the license depends on the specific Services and selected settings.
For all Services other than Live, Local or other crowdsourced services, you provide Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc.
and its affiliates with a territorially unlimited, free, transferable license and sublicensing right to host, store, use, display, duplicate, modify, adapt, edit, publish and distribute content for as long as you use the Services.
The license is granted for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting and improving the Services, and researching and developing new Services.
Because Live, Local, and other crowdsourced services are public services by nature and document events of interest to the public, the license you grant to us for the content you upload to these Services is broader.
In addition to the permissions set out in the preceding paragraph, you also license us to create derivative works, promote, exhibit, transmit, distribute, sublicense, publicly perform and publicly display content uploaded to Live, Local and other crowdsourced services in any content and on all media and distribution methods (known now or developed later).
To the extent that it is necessary, when the user creates, uploads or publishes content on the Live, Local service or other service using crowdsourcing or appears in such content, Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc. also provides,
entities associated with them and business partners with an unlimited object and territorial license to use the user's name and surname, image and voice.
This means, among other things, that you are not entitled to any compensation from Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc.,
their affiliates and business partners if their name, image or voice appears on Live, Local or any other crowdsourced service, whether in the Snapchat app or on the platform of one of our business partners.
Additional information on third party access to user content can be found in the Privacy Policy and Support page.
While we are not obligated to do so, we may check, review, filter and remove your content at any time and for any reason, including if we believe that your content violates these Terms.
Regardless of this, you are solely responsible for the content that you create, upload, post or store on the Services.
The Services may contain advertising.
In return for enabling you to access and use the Services, you agree that Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc.,
its affiliates and third party partners may place advertisements on the Services, including personalized advertisements based on information that you have provided to us, or that we have collected or obtained from you.
Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide to us, advertisements may, from time to time, appear near your content.
The opinions of our users are very valuable to us.
However, those who voluntarily provide feedback or suggestions should be aware that we may use them without any compensation whatsoever.
4.
Other People's Content.
Most of the content on our Services is created by users, publishers and other third parties.
Regardless of whether they are posted publicly or sent privately, the person or organization that posted them is solely responsible for them.
While Snap Group Limited reserves the right to review any content that appears on the Services and remove any content that violates these Terms, it does not necessarily review all of them.
Therefore, it cannot and is not responsible for the content provided via the Services by other persons.

We make every effort to make the Services a safe place for all users.
However, we cannot guarantee such security.
By using the Services, you agree to the following restrictions:
You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms.
You will not use robots, spiders, crawlers, scrapers, or other automated methods or interfaces to access or extract the data of other users from the Services.
You will not use or develop third party applications that communicate with the Services or other users' content and data without our written consent

The user will not ask other users for their credentials.
You will not post content that contains pornography, gross violence, threats, hate speech or incitement to violence.

while driving the vehicle).
Also, don't put yourself or others at risk to create a Snap.
9.
User's account
You are responsible for all activities performed under your Snapchat account.
It is therefore important that the account is properly secured.
One method of security is to set a strong password that has not been used previously on other accounts.
By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to using common sense:
The user will not create more than one account for himself.
You will not create another account if the previous one has been blocked by us, unless you have obtained our written consent.
You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease a Snapchat, Live, Snaps account, Snapchat account name, or a friend link without our written consent.
The user will not share his password with other people.
You will not log into the Services or attempt to access them through any unauthorized third-party application or client.
If you believe someone has accessed your account, please contact Snapchat Support immediately
10.
Memories
Memories is our data storage service that allows you to access your memories anytime and anywhere.
Memories is automatically turned on when you agree to these Terms.
Once enabled, the service remains on as long as you have a Snapchat account.
However, it is possible to disable some Memories features in Settings.
One of the options available in Memories is to create a restricted area by setting an access code in the form of a PIN, password, or other mechanism.
The effect is similar to the option to block a mobile device; By setting a passcode, you are less likely to be able to see the content that is stored in your Memories Restricted Area when someone else possesses your device.
But be warned: if you lose your access code, forget it, or enter the wrong code too many times, you will lose access to the content stored in the restricted area.
We do not offer a code recovery function for this area.
The user is solely responsible for remembering the code.
More information about access codes can be found on the Support page.
Content that you have saved on Memories may become inaccessible for a number of reasons, such as a service glitch or our decision to terminate your account.
As we cannot promise that your content will always be available, we recommend that you keep a separate copy of the content you save on Memories.
We do not promise that Memories will be large enough to meet your storage needs.
We reserve the right to set space limits on the Memories Service and to change them from time to time at our sole discretion.
As with other Services, your use of Memories may consume space on your device and incur data transmission charges.
Memories cannot be resold.
This means that the user cannot use this service to run his own file storage or distribution service for third parties.
11.
Data and cell phone charges
You are responsible for mobile network transmission charges that you may incur when using our Services, including SMS and data charges.
If you are unsure of what these fees are, please check with your mobile provider prior to using the Services.
If a user changes or deactivates the mobile number they used to create their Snapchat account, they must update their account details in Settings within 72 hours to prevent messages targeting them from reaching someone else.
12.
Third party services
If you use a service, feature, or functionality provided by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services that we offer jointly with a third party), the relationship between you and that third party is governed by that third party's terms.
Snap Group Limited i Snap Inc.
are not responsible for the conditions of third parties or actions taken on their basis.
13.
Modification and Termination of Services
We constantly improve our Services and create new ones.
This means that we can add or remove features, products and functionality from them, and suspend or suspend them entirely.
We may take these actions at any time, and if so, we will try to inform you in advance, although this may not always be possible.
While we hope that you will enjoy Snapchat for many years, you may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.
Snap Group Limited may also terminate these Terms at any time for any reason.
Although we will try to inform you in advance, we cannot guarantee that we will succeed.
Our right to terminate these Terms means that we may stop providing you with the Services, or impose new or additional restrictions on your ability to use the Services.
For example, we may delete your user account for extended inactivity and block your username at any time for any reason.
Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Group Limited will remain bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10 and 13-22 of the Terms.
